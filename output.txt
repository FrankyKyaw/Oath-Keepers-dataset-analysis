Cool mike
Did it make you change your password?
Test test test!
Did you guys have to change your password?
Im in
I really need to know that.
Did you have to change your password?
Yes, reequired after sing-in
Good!  Success!
required after sign-in
Ed can you forward the email to me at jpj@oathkeepers.org.  I want to have at it and make sure it looks like I expected.
@rcadmin Done
So you guys are welcome to play with it a bit.  As Ed and I discussed I next need to write a routine to create the rooms and do a few other little things.  Once the rooms are created I will be nuking all the test accounts and mass building the accounts for all the troops.
Stuck Mike?
Call me if it would be easier.
The server url is at the top of your browser, but it is https://chat.oathkeepers.org/
Seems to function ok. Can‚Äôt edit profile yet, but that‚Äôs ok
great job! Thanks for your hard work on this
You are most welcome.  I can not often go out on OPS, but this I can do.
Saved profile
Still the same avatar
We may have to tweak a setting for avatar.
Ed do we have PR, VI and Guam outposts?  Should I do rooms for them?
Can‚Äôt connect on rocket app though
Ok well I have never used the app so I will have to install it and see what is going on.
Desktop of phone?
Android or iPhone?
tried to upload screenshot of error message but it won‚Äôt accept it
Websocket is disabled for this server
Not sure if uploads are turned on.  Send it to me in a private signal message
Not sure who the little R is as your name is now gone
ok. Hey, issues are expected. Glad to see the progress
Thanks Rev!
That is what I needed to know
I will look into that after I get the rooms created and clean up a couple of things.
Who let Kim Jung Yun in here?
Or is that Elton John?
Have to find that in the settings again.
Ok disabled account creation
Thanks for that find.
I am going to take a break and tend to some non-OK things.  Please send issues, concerns, suggestions to jpj@oathkeepers.org.
Ok.....I may have to enable something for apps to work.  Have to check the docs.  That is on my list.
First time on this app. Gonna poke around...
I do not know rev-mike.  I have not looked at the mobile app yet.
Team let me know if your phone apps are working please.
Ok so I am not the only one that can connect by phone app
Phone app working.
Android or iPhone?
Check check. Seems to function in ios app
Thanks GA-Jim
In with phone.  Checking profile update now.
Washington DC
No profile update. Add me to NJ and I will test room.
I think you should be able to just join it Ed.
Also you should be an admin now.  You may have to log out and back in.  I am not sure.
This is all I see. "# general"
Is there life in NJ?
Odd because they are all public rooms.  Maybe I have to do something to make them visible.
I see them.
But I created them
Are you guys seeing any other channels?
I am now. When I was on previously I did not. Joined GA. Can you make me admin in it
Logged out as admin and in as myslef GA-Jim.  So you were able to see and join GA?
Hello NY!
Ok let me log in as admin and I will set you for GA
Ok give me a moment to figure it out
No problem. No rush
I think I did it Jim.
It says you are now the room leader.  See if you have enhanced powers and abilities.
To find channels you are not a member of click on the globe.
I don‚Äôt think so, but I‚Äôm trying to remember lol
This is my first dance with RC.  Before I started dealing with the OK tech I could not log into ANYTHING.
So I never installed or admined RC before now.  Never used it either.
I know Ed made private rooms before the crash. We had state rooms for only vetted members and admin controls. No idea how he did it. It‚Äôs possible controls will show up when non admin members join. Maybe
I know it‚Äôs trivial but the avatar won‚Äôt allow changes yet. 
This is an open room.  Ed told me to make open rooms then make closed rooms as well when a state leader asks for it.
Once you‚Äôre confident it‚Äôs ready I‚Äôd like to bring my state leaders in so we can ensure they are fully up to speed on this, then we can add them in the private chat and test that. If all goes well we can start bringing our vetted members in. I know it‚Äôs been tough trying to obtain new members as this is the only way we become aware of new sign ups, if they followed the old instructions to join the forum. Been asking for the state membership list for 8 months to get things started right. I‚Äôm told we may finally get access soon
@rcadmin Please create admin account for rocketman
rocketman is no more
Why not just use your account?  You are an admin.
Not seeing the admin controls
Try logging out and back in?
It says admin next to your name
Click the E upper left and you should see admin controls
You can make yourself the owner of this room if you like.
Actually it is leader
Good morning and God bless, patriots.
Folks who are local to Cochranville, PA and the surrounding area.
Folks who believe that turning back to God is the only viable path forward for America.
For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man, in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit. ‚Äî Romans 8:3-4

Efforts to Save Friends and Family From the Evil Vaccines
Nothing is more frustrating than being told by family and friends that you are "wearing a tin foil hat" when you try to discuss what is going on in America!
This fake pandemic has proven that it really is possible to fool some of the people all of the time.
I learned long ago that most people are too busy with their meager lives, to stop and take the time to investigate and search for the TRUTH.
People just absorb the Leftist Socialist propaganda like sponges in water, because they saw it on TV.
The feeling of futility is indescribable. When YOU know the truth, but they will not listen.
I have learned that it is not that they DO NOT hear it.  It is that they WILL NOT hear it.
Friends have gone anead and taken the jab, and now I can do nothing but watch them die.
Hey everyone,  so glad to see oathkeepers back up.
Good morning fellow Patriots from Wisconsin, Good to be back on line.

I've got some Intel for EVERYBODY. The following link is a direct link to monitor Antifa and BLM communications activities. BEFORE you click on it, MAKE SURE you have a good VPN to cloak your IP address so they cannot discover your location.
If you're unfamiliar with this, it is what #Antifa/BLM use to communicate with each other. Do not click on it unless you have a good VPN to hide your IP address. If they are not streaming all you will see is a blank page.
https://woke.net/
This Intel came to me via a friend in the Colorado Militia whose group has infiltrated Antifa in Colorado. He also has a list of names of EVERY MEMBER of Antifa in the U.S. I downloaded a copy of it in an Excell XML file and the first page contains 13,019 members alone I do not see a way to upload it here, but we'll have to find a way to do it for your benefit.

Found it with the search glass icon.
It‚Äôll take time to get used to it. This was our only method of grabbing new members joining, so with it back up and running we will be able to grow the group. We just have to ensure those that are joining this chat know the process of integrating into the state chapter

Hello from AZ..
Morning from NE
Good morning from Texas.  Does anyone know how I am supposed to pay my $50.00?  The payment app on the website doesn't appear to me working.
So i had joined not too long before the shut down and even moved my houses.. never got ahold of anyone or received my member card.. is there a pinal county group or san tan valley group here in AZ?
I agree. I'm also an Organizer for NC on the My Patriot Network. trying to establish an overall network in NC so everyone can connect on the County level, regardless of their group affiliation. The County level is where real change can happen. Pleased to meet you. Working on a County Group right now.
Now that I can consent to!
God bless NC
Forget the RNC give to this instead:
I'm sorry.  I am late to the party. What was this post in reference to?
check http://s4a1.com
I can't even get the payment app on the website to wrok. I'd love to be able to pay my dues
I did. Obviously the apple didn't fall to far from the tree!
I see. I am a lawyer with my own firm but am very new to the group, so perhaps later I guess.
I love it here.  Plenty of acreage for sale, but not really being developed like what is happening a little further south.  Not a fan of houses stacked on top of each other
I guess I just need to get ahold of some of the Texas guys to figure out how to pay for membership
Good morning everyone from the Coastal Empire. Re

You have to remember one thing about hyper-inflation: it's designed to help those who are heavily indebted with fixed interest rates and to harm the holders of the debt (which, in turn, stifles lending and the continued acquisition of wealth). So leftists want hyperinflation because it helps control the people while giving them the illusion of a gift
Saw your invite. I'm interested, too. Will be good to share ideas.

Hey brother, how do we know this is a valit site for comms - with end to end encryption?
This is the resurrected forum and rocket chat that was taken down in January. 
LOL! That's where your Dad got the info about the phone! I cant keep up with him. He feeds me info faster than I can process it. Then again I have too many irons in the fire trying to get this country back on track... among other life demands.
I didn't see anything on the OK website saying it was back up...
I can get you in touch with IT. They managed to get it back up and know the details. It was via email and the comms we‚Äôve been on since it was taken down

The valley is beautiful, but if you want to see "God's Country, take a drive down through Skyline and Princeton, AL. coming south from Huntland, TN.  That whole area from Hwy 65 East to Mentone, AL is where my native ancestry lived prior to, and during,  the Trail of Tears.  Of course, that is just the foothills of the Smokies and the Blue Ridge Pkwy.  I love the mountains, and it's kind of cool seeing them (the foothills) in the distance across the flat valley around here.

Hello from Kentucky
VA here!
Just a recommendation...  Using a browser in this case... Click on your Avatar in the top left of this page...  Then go to My Account...  Then go to Security... Then enable the two factor login for enhanced security.  This will make it a little harder for someone to hack your Oath Keepers Chat.
How long will this site last? Place your bets now!
Good morning
Was the Texas power problem a part of it or "deep state"?
Ken this is hosted on our own server infrastructure.  Sadly we are still renting servers from others, but we are working on that too.
It should be required.  I wonder if the admin can require that.  It is one of the only things that will keep the hackers out.  I just assume they have my password anymore.
Our big problem right now is that our credit card processor has kicked us off.  We can not process membership dues or donations.
We have  no one at this point.
Hello from the state of King Cuomo II
jpj, seeing as you are admin I have to ask, are there plans of cutting ties with or at least not listing the big tech SM free speech crushing giants as com options on our site? There are so many to choose from now and it seems counterintuitive for Oath Keepers to be supporting those who seek to deplatform us.
Jump into the NY chat mindphazer.  There are a few NY folks here with us.
ssgtgman I am not sure what you are asking.
Somebody took my monthly membership dues on 3/1....
I'm here everybody!
If a payment was processed we got the money, but I found out last night from the person that deals with our payment that we were dropped.
On the oathkeepers.org website we have Twitter & Instagram among others listed as communication options. Why when they are part of the problem?
Because we have been scrambling to just get back to operational and the 1 person that updates the wordpress has not had time to drop those things since I got the web site back up and running.
I personally wouldn't mind going back to the old bulletin board systems hosted on private servers.  There are enough MFA mechanisms now to secure that sort of platform and it's incredibly easy to build out and maintain.  The hardest part is just getting the base groups and permissions set up.
All good. It just seems we should be working with gab, bitchute, odysee and such.
Any members in the northern New England region that have a chance to reach out, this newbie looks forward to hearing from you.

@rcadmin Do we have policies in place for strong password requirements?  Also, are you going to put in place a requirement for people to use 2 factor authentication?  Last question, are you going to put a policy in place to kill idle accounts and force users to change passwords every 60 days or so?
2 factor is a must for everyone reguardless of policy.  It is just good security Practice.  I enabled mine immediately after signing in.
I'm really glad to see us back up. It's been too long.
As did I but being in the IT business myself, it needs to be a policy or the average Joe will not do it.

Hi from the Peoples Republic of California where our main export is communist politicians. Sorry.
I don't mean to be rude, but I don't get the point of this chatroom. It seems like a huge waste of time for me.
I don't take your comment as rude, but being a direct person myself, If you don't get the point of trying to get to know like minded individuals in your area so that it becomes easier to come together in times of need, then maybe you don't need to be here.
marineresearch we all have to educate our neighbors, the more moderate ones.  That is the only way to save the Republic.
Hello from Florida!
Then a time may come when CA and NYC are no longer turning the Gov communist.
cannot teach anything to those who already know everything - they have blinders on and plugged their ears
yes it is frustrating - lesson is to shake the dust off your feet and walk on
The entire thing is a hoax.  Calculations of transmission rates and all of that are meaningless.  It is the FLU, pure and simple.  Influenza A or Influenza B.  Look at your DATA, but look at ALL of the DATA as well.  Numbers are meaningless, when you are calculating rates and numbers based on arbitrary opening and closing of testing sites.  Combine this with the fact that the PCR test gives false positives 97% of the time.
Watch this - https://brandnewtube.com/upload/videos/2021/02/SEnipDQgY8zhQ7EzOzdD_20_7b46c5915de55e7da9e6ed102db892a8_video_1080p_converted.mp4
jpj...working the problem one at a time. We have a lot of Biden voters with buyer‚Äôs regret that‚Äôs turning into a healthy crowd for the Newsom recall.
1.5 percent of patriots who supported the revolution - made it happen.  we had that many in dc on 1-6 - which makes me hopeful that all is not lost
I wonder when they will start "normalizing" the words MANDATORY VACCINES.  We all know it is coming.  The Mark of the Beast.
i agree
It is so frustrating to share information I have gatherd with people who are oh-so-busy with their lives that they do not take the time to learn.  So I send then data, and video links, and everything, and they say, "Just enjoy life! It will all work out!"  They do not understand the deep level of EVIL that is this pandemic hoax.
CQ, CQ, CQ. Keeping.AZ reporting for duty. . . . Is this thing working? ;)
That is great marineresearch.  If Newsom can be recalled it will be a good start.
Fools say this is NOT The Mark of te Beast, yet they have no answer when I ask them, "What do you call something you MUST BEAR, in order to enter a public place, or ride a plane, or a bus, or walk into a restaurant, or send your children to school, or even hold a job?"
and those who surrendered their freedoms will give the unvaccinated the stink eye.  "YOU are the reason we still have to wear masks!  Why don't YOU let them inject this CRAP into YOUR bloodstream, so we can all get back to _normal?!_"
People have FORGOTTEN about the Thalidomide Babies, which is the results of the last time a "vaccine" was rushed through without clinical trials.
I grew up with them in Chicago.  They were victims of a horrible experiment gone wrong.
So the LEMMINGS are rushing to get the vaccines.  I am waiting for the reports, in about seven months now, of the horrible birth defects, and the miscarriages, and the other consequences of these vaccines.
and it will be TOO LATE for those who have volunteered to be LAB RATS for Bill Gates.
I surely hope that there are still enough MEN in this country to do what will be necessary to purge this nation of the enemies within.  So many soy boys out there who dread the thought of losing their big screen TVs or messing up their man buns to actually lift a finger to help.
We are still in the process of recovering from being deplatformed by liquid web.  We will be using this as a way to organize things like email campaigns, in person lobby efforts and anything else we need to do to bring constitutional government back.
yes you are correct -
1.5 percent of patriots who supported the revolution - made it happen. we had that many in dc on 1-6 - which makes me hopeful that all is not lost

... Can you send me a dozen rolls please?"
we just need to stick together and choose targets wisely
and DISCREETLY
I sure would like to find a local group of patriots.
me too
I sure pray that what I have heard about coming events is TRUE.  I will NOT vote again, if this stolen election is allowed to stand.
and people ... the STUPID is strong with them!  People are trying to ONE UP each other, by going to ridiculous extremes with this sanitation lunacy.  It is off the charts STUPID!
You carry a BOX into UPS, and they wipe it down with sanitizing wipes before they take it in.
There could be a severed human head IN the box, oh but it was sanitized on the outside so it is good to go!
Greetings fellow Ohioan 
Hello ALSO from Kentucky!
can't fix stupid
What a world we live in!
the insanity is off the charts
I really feel for you foolks stuck in COMMIEfornia
They talk about the ballot fraud in the last election, but NO ONE talks about the constant and ongoing ballot fraud that occurs in EVERY California election.  It USED TO BE a RED STATE!
You guys in Florida are doing it right
Here is, without a doubt, the most BEAUTIFUL graphic on the Internet!  Watch, as the country moves decidedly PRO-Second Amendment from 1986 to 2021    http://gun-nuttery.com/rtc.php
Is there an active chapter in Colorado?
Well, that explains why I have not been able to pay. I am happy to send a check and a paper application.
Also, if you drop me an e-mail, I know of a credit card processor that actually respects the First and Second Amendment. I use them for my business and I bet they would be happy to accept business from the Oathkeepers. They are called 2nd Amendment Processing. https://www.secondamendmentprocessing.com/
I use 2nd Amendment Processing for my business and they are great. Veteran owned as well.  https://www.secondamendmentprocessing.com/

Hello guys; glad we are back able to communikate
From Kingman
Keeping.AZ not all of those are members of OK.  Last I heard from SR only 2 were dues paying members.  Jessica and one other.
Is there currently a way to know which of us are actual members vs those waiting on vetting?  I pay membership dues, but haven't received anything official in the mail.  I haven't even done any sort of formal interview or anything of the such.  I am assuming that there is an actual vetting process, so I am curious how many here are actual members vs "pledges" so to speak :grin:
Looking for some neighbors.  This is a lonely state.
For those using the Brave browser, the shield blocks most features, reporting 43 ads and other creepy things blocked. I hope one of those creepy things isn‚Äôt named Joe.

Also, if you need more mods, I would be willing to help.
All patriotic Americans need to develop a legal team to assist victims of DOJ RICO actions against innocents, including pastors preaching on Sundays when they're supposed to be closed, and shop keepers when they open in violation of mandates. RICO - Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.     (Racket: organized illegal activity.  Does that describe DOJ or FBI?)

Last I knew there was nothing of the sort anywhere in Kansas. Maybe a small cluster of individuals sparsely located here and there but nothing that can really be considered 'organized' by any means.
Figured out how to make a room on my own.
What Wray said about us when he was deflecting a question on the communist riots all summer was disappointing to say the least but I guess we know now what the fbi leadership thinks. Im in Wa state too by the way. Make sure you check in on the WA chat.
I wonder what they have planned that they think they need to protect themselves in DC.
I know they are planning on mandatory gun grabbing.  They know from history that may not end well.  Once everyone is disarmed they can move on to forming ghettos then camps.  These socialists think patriots like us are evil and they can do no wrong in their attempts to destroy us.  History is our guide.
Hello i am a new member RedPatriot76/21
Semper Fi. to all brothers and sisters. I for one will not surrender my weapons. I will die or go to prison.
skipsavino, you are on target. Understand much what they say and post is the fear plan like wearing the mask. Yes we need to get together at a time and place. Let us not forget Lexington April 19, 1775.
I know the feeling, TS09.  Unless you're tied to this state by a job or family, most folks like us have already left.
OK. I am going 10/4.

So we have been out of touch with things that happened Jan 6.  OK was and has been plated on the news everywhere as militia, and I call that out every chance I can, but what's being done?
9/11 we were so united, nothing could break us.  Well except that dope Dubbya
I paid my dues and joined right as we lost comms...my OK patches came but i havnt heard from any leadership about anything else...im in WNC..any info appreciated
Whats up 402?
Hello from Virginia! Glad to see this is back up. I want to share some information for you all to ponder. Look for the things that don't happen but should have. Inauguration video was a mixture of cloud and bright sunlight but according to NOAA it SHOULD have been mostly cloudy.  Biden took his oath ten minutes early but SHOULD have at 12:01 by the Constitution. The 21-Gun Salute SHOULD have begun at the first note of the song "Hail to the Chief" following the swearing-in. There was no gun salute for Biden. Following the Inauguration the criminals allegedly went to Arlington for a wreath-laying ceremony. Biden SHOULD have assisted the military member placing the wreath on the stand (hence the term "wreath laying") but it was already on the stand when Joe and the Ho showed up. While at the ceremony there was a 21-Gun Salute but the interval of the shots was 10-seconds. This type of salute is for full-honors funerals or visiting heads of foreign countries. Is Joe the president of the U.S. or president of D.C. which is technically not in the U.S. So what I'm getting at is there is likely a military op going on. Be cool but keep gearing up. Look for the SHOULDS.
Hello from Tampa. Moving to Brooksville. Looking for contacts.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=j19oVS0yES8kqVQpd) I think people treat Trump a bit too much like a Jesus savior.  The constitution is we the people, not Trump.  We're the ones that get to say when this ends.
I would have thought the spark would have happened after all the civil liberties lost, but I'm guessing it's going to have to get a lot worse.  Bottom line is it's not going to be easy and people will be branded as terrorists and hated by the general public.
We must take action locally to take back our elections.  We, at the county and state level, must nullify unconstitutional federal interference with our elections.  We must remove corrupt elections officials.  We must do election recounts.  We must stand against the evil or it will succeed.
KansasValues, many have been doing that and are ignored.  Our elected representatives no longer represent us.  So what do you do when the system is bought and paid for?
Branden-88, it goes beyond even that now.  If you're conservative, christian or even don't want your kids to be pumped full of hormones and allowed to have sex with trannies you're a terrorist bigot to these psychos.
We've got to get law enforcers educated and on our side to stand against elections corruption.  The election watchers who were kept out of monitoring elections should have gotten themselves arrested for pressing against the illegalities.  That would have been embarrassing for the establishment/corruption.  I'm not sure I'm there yet - but we must be willing to stand against corruption and evil even if we get arrested and slanderous news articles are written about us and church friends wag their fingers and tongues.  We must be willing to pay the price.  (I'm trying to get there.)
still think it's going to take quite a bit more before people start shooting like our forefathers did.  People didn't even do that as Antifa/BLM burned down their lives and murdered due to the threat of the two-tiered justice system.  Most have too much to lose.  I feel like I want to fight and am ready, but admit jail is not an attractive outcome.
I'm seeing a lot of conservative people realizing they can no longer sit back and watch the battle from the sidelines.  Many are standing up and looking for opportunities to get plugged in - like becoming active in the Republican party as precinct committeemen - in Kansas there are many openings and it's really easy to volunteer.  We can also go to school board meetings, county commission meetings, city council meetings, or even just monitor the minutes of the meetings or listen to audio or video recordings.  But in actuality the stuff will probably hit the fan long before even the next election comes.  Find like minded people, setup communications, strategize together.  (I've not been very successful yet.)  Many are waking up - but it's still a very small number compared to what is needed.
HELLO ALL
Branden, I agree with you that I want my kids to grow up in a different world than what we have now.  Suppose when if conservatives start organizing it'll seem less daunting.  Right now I'm deep behind enemy lines in Chicago.
is there a stickied post about how prior system was taken down?
i'm assuming all the web stuff has been moved to Epik?
Tou must understand that the 16 or so OK that were charged with the capital were done with copies of their comms on a chat......anybody ever hear of OPSECS?....plz. if their is leadership here reading these chats....contact me..im in NC joined right as we lost comms and meed contact.....
and how can we donate to legal defense for members picked up?
Great question.....i would donate
Just need contact from brothers/sisters here in nc....i have skills i can share ect.......wouldnt hurt to keep sharp..just in case
Looking for contact with brothers/ sisters here in NC...i have skills to share ......doesnt hurt to stay sharp.....just in case!!!
Great information for all to read. The best ideas I have read to date for how to take back our country.  www.WeThePeopleConvention.org   Be sure to read the letter that was written to President Trump before the CPAC convention. Greetings from SW Florida, a great state with a great governator!
18 wheel mobile in Nevada here. I, like the rest of you brothers and sisters, am tired of my country being shit on by these freaks! I am a retired comms engineer. I think it is past time to get organization. Think about this... In 1775, the Patriots met in Pubs, Social Halls and Churches to organize. What has the Covid lockdowns prevented? Organizing! WE need a plan!
This new server started around 3 am eastern today..and from the shear amount of people i can see that are coming on...it's a huge following....imagine if we were organized...does anyone on here actually physically see anyone else on a regular basis as an OK...like meetings or one of these conferences im reading about on the OK website
I live in the Reno area. I have pretty much all the calibers for reloading in dies a few presses and some brass. Having problems find small pistol primers and small rifle primers. I have a few Mag primers. WE nee to organize! over 30 years comms engineer and ham. OK NV Ron / greywolfron@protonmail.com
It has been painful not having OathKeepers chat since it was de-platformed back in Jan. [they] are trying to keep us from organizing! For future reference. I run the website PatriotRoster.com. I also have a open encrypted chatroom on Telegram at "Chumpy_Deplorables".
I didn't Rev!
It is TOTALLY encrypted comms Rev.
Welcome aboard
Telegram is a encrypted comms system that allows text, Voice and Video comms. with channels and groups.
Telegram.org to get the app or program.
I have some updating to do to the site.
I am also a ham radio operator. I ask people how they will communicate when the internet and cell phones go down. They don't know. I am trying to get OathKeeper hams together for some state to state on air meets. Lets do this!
I am not a Ham operator, but next best thing CB. Radio.
Nice Rev! Register with PatiotRoster.com then go check out the drop downs under "You Ready?" for How to make antennas and what radios you need!
CB radio does NOT get out far enough Charley. A couple of miles at best. But get the equipment if nothing else! In an emergency, be ready!
A 100 watt amp on a CB. Will do the trick.
2 meter is line of site comms. Good for comms within a couple of miles or repeater service. HF radios go around the world!
I hear people out of Texas on the CB. Back in the day i use to talk to Europe and South America with a CB.
I cancelled all my social media accounts with anybody that wanted to suppress free speech. Support the good people we already have. Primary out all RINOS. Murkowski, McConnell, Graham, Collins, Romney, etc. Replace them with your votes for people like Rep. Matt Gaetz FL. Support your governors that want to tell the FEDS to take a flying leap with their oppressive laws.  Gov. Abbott in TX has got the ball rolling. GAB, Rumble, BitChute, etc. are all good alternatives for social media without oppression.  Get your concealed weapons permits if you are in states that don't have open carry. They are definitely planning more mass shootings so that they can ram the legislation through. Count on it. The more people we have carrying, the better chance we have of thwarting an incident. Get yourself a VPN installed on your computer so your IP address can't be traced. Protect yourself.
Yes Charley, it is called "Skip" Those stations are running massive power and it only works in certain sun cycles.
Virtual private network
I'm in!!
A good one is "SurfShark" Dad.
I explain all of that on Patriot Dad.
Yes jbrown
I wrote an article you can see here on PatriotRoster once you register. https://www.patriotroster.com/antennas/
I know it was skip, but at the time i was only using 100 watts with a stick antenna.
Oh, one last thing. Get on your knees and pray. Prayer is the most powerful tool we have and don't forget it! Good night and God bless you all!
Yep, I used to do it too. Not a reliable means of comms.
Good night SDA
Greetings from Cochise County
Another social media platform is CloutHub.
The Patriots are back online in big numbers. The III orig. folded but a new "The 3" has begun. Silverhammer, missed you on the comms app. Quite a few, including leadership left. It looks like the vetting process is basically null and void. I was waiting for more than 6 weeks then the lead left the group. New group vetted in a couple of days. If this becomes what it was before the chat was nixed with nothing more than internet complaints, news posts and commentary, no vetting process and a huge lack of comms with and by leadership I won't hang around to long. There is much to be done, but in an organized and orderly fashion. Two strikes, your out!
Yes Charley, I am GreyWolf on that platform as well. I was on the beta testing team for that platform a while back.
Exactly, if it's anything like it was before I won't be hanging around for long. No vetting process and a lack of leadership direction and or comms. I waited 6 weeks to be vetted then the lead left the group with zero communication. I was vetted in 2 days by a new group replacing a disbanded group.
Comms are key! Without comms, you cannot organize! Leadership and Comms are needed at this time! We cannot let out country fail to tyranny!
If we lose our Republic, the whole free(ish) World will follow. The disarmed Brits don't have a chance. See "another day in la la land"  https://vernoncoleman.org/
I suggest we start setting up state by state meetings. Get leaders for each state. Maybe even Regions.
Well, it seems that get to know like minded individuals in my area was a one way street and then I was left hanging out to dry by "leadership" and the no vetting process.
Comms redundancies are also needed! We cannot have outages like what happened here in Jan STOP comms!
I don't know dad. I know I was approached to start working with another OK ham in Florida, but I never received contact from him. If anyone know a OK member that is a ham, point him my way!
In the words of James Yeager when they come for one of your brothers that's when we need to show up! Lets hope these boys are not hung out to dry for to long before some action is taken, besides sitting on the sidelines as a spectator.
One thing is certain Dad, I also mention in in my mission statement on PatirotRoster. ANTIFA and BLM have comms! How do you think [they] can have a 1,000 people in an instant show up to a flash protest? They use Telegram and Signal! I would NOT use Signal, it is run by the C_A.
But, WE don't have comms like that! That needs to change NOW!
Telegram is off shore. It cannot be de-platformed. And is encrypted. So it is good to use until the net goes down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbEz1qauINM  Taking any bodies stuff is a parallel to trumped up charges of criminal activity when there is none!
The main problem is "VETTING" how do you do that?
Infiltrators are a certainty. A process needs to be developed to do Vetting. We do NOT have the resources for that. ANYONE can sign in and be a badd guy.
Yeah, I think we should take matters into our own hands on here. Setup State and Regional leaders. Then the leaders of each Region and State meet with all other states. Discuss the issues and plans.
WE are Oath Keepers! IF not in membership of this site, by virtue of OUR OWN OATHS to defend the Constitution of the United States!
One word..... Command!
They are NOT encrypted. Great to gather....
I do NOT have a problem mentoring people either.  30+ years in all levels of comms. From Satellite work to Class 4 Microwave, Ham Radio, Internet VOIP systems, and so on.
I like it JB!
Bravo37, 100% agree. Stating what you think you observed and what actually happened may be being confused. No evidence besides conjecture supports anything binx said. BTW, a prophet must be 100% correct or else it is a false prophet. Deuteronomy 18:15-22
I've been thinking a lot about this, just as all of you have and reading opinions across the 'net and the conclusion i've come to is you got to start movements in the local communities.  Get those that are just waking up to open their eyes and see the truth, teach and train them to prepare, and be ready to spread the word the old fashioned way.
Like I said. Let me take one of the first steps. I am in #NV. I know that there are OK NV around, but they may not be back on the system yet. As I said, I have the PatriotRoster site. I can create a Telegram group as well for meeting.
The net doesn't forget anything and has a tendency to bite you in the ass later on
Bite away... We Cannot let that stop us!
I used to have a email signature that read..."If you are plugged into the Internet, the Internet is plugged into you!"
Well no fkn shit!
Strength in numbers, but that strength doesn't work if you are 1000s of miles apart.  Kinda hard to muster quickly then
True Zep... This is why we must setup regional leadership and meetings. Then State, then national!
ANTIFA does it....We sure as hell figure it out!
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=ixRaSapGwZDsHFueg) I'm a software engineer so I'd just write my own app and install it on my device myself so you are outside the control of Apple.  Being your own app, you'd control the logic and encryption.  The problem with AES is that it employs a black box algorithm that was developed by in part by the US government.  We're seeing now they know how to break it.
I've tried for the last year to find local OKs to meet out here in SoCal, then the coms out killed that
So will you play the political game by their rules and backstab, slander, lie, break the law to get "elected" and basically become exactly what we are fighting against? If so, then be my guest and by all means join the good ole' boys club. Otherwise, try adhering to some measure of integrity and good character attributes and see where that gets you. A big waste of time if you ask me. Or you have to have a special calling to be among wolves in sheeps clothing. I believe there is only one way this changes and it has nothing to do with getting involved in politics at the local, regional, state or national level. That is what needs to be done AFTER the mess is cleaned up.
Here is where I am ALWAYS on! Web powered chat boards to NOT get you close enough. Great for making 1st contact. Good night Dad! https://t.me/Chumpy_Deplorables
Get the app at Telegram.org
I have people in NY, SC, NC, FL, CA and many other states in the chat. Air monitors and Citizen Reporters.
I just tested clipboard imaging here. It failed.
Howdy and welcome!

not a vet, always a Marine!
His Fraudulency?
I‚Äôm in the Bay Area, down to get involved. 
Trump is the rightful president
greywolf are you a computer programmer?
OK meeting or something else?
Media and the alphabet depts have us and other groups in the crosshairs.  Definately stay behaved and frosty
Sorry, I was on Chumpy.. I used to be. I retired as V.P. of Ops and Engineering in the Silicon Valley for a Global Internet Based Company.
Nope, I am.  Was replying to him
Most likely any audit will be ignored judging how things have been going
That's advantageous and we should use that frustration to open everyone's eyes
I agree with jb
I am putting 10 toes up between the sheets. Good Night Patriots!
So greywolf if you were a V.P. of Ops and Engineering in the Silicon Valley for a Global Internet Based Company you must know something about free software.  You must also be able to at least read some code.  I would suggest a good exercise might be to have a look at the signal source code.  The source code has been audited by others including Snowden, but it is there for anyone to check.  I think if you check it you will see the E2E crypto is solid.  The only breaches have been from unsecured devices falling into the hands of oath breakers, or folks installing malware on their phones with hidden screen shot capability.  Anyone using signal needs to do the following:  
main menu -> Settings -> Privacy

Turn on:

Screen Lock
Screen Security

Set Inactivity timeout to something not too big.  Mine is 1 min.
The issue with E2E crypto is most are using AES
As with most good crypto systems the people are the weak link.  We got enigma broken in WWII partly due to the habits of one german telegraphy radio operator.
1984isNow signal does not use AES read the code.
What crypto is signal using?
They developed their own.
Signal started as TextSecure and RedPhone two different programs when phones were not powerful enough to run both things at once.
I'm curious if they actually did.  Most companies lie about that stuff.
imjustice signal is very secure
Secure isn't so much the issue, it's that others know the secret to breaking it.
1984isNow signal crypto has not been broken
See my comments above
I'd be curious to look at the source code and see how they did it.  Broken in the sense of, if they wrote it they know the decryption secret.
I'm not an expert on encryption, but I've worked on it a bit for software.
Signal data has been compromised from unlocked devices where the bad actors just read the messages when the device was captured.
The other compromise was trojans installed on phones that do screen shots.  Signal has a defense against that now, but you have to turn it on in settings.
Everyone knows how PGP/GPG works and has for more than 25 years, but that does not mean you can just decrypt it without the proper secret key.
most modern day encryptions need a public and private key to decrypt.  It's near impossible for someone on the outside to break, but like AES since it was developed in part by the US government they can just break it with the public key since they developed it.  That's where I was going with this line of thought.
Same for signal.  The code is published and anyone can read it or modify it, but that does not mean the txt crypted with it can be broken without having the proper secrets, secrets that are different from user to user.
Have a look at the code rather than tossing FUDD
Sure for outside users, but if Signal themselves wanted to see what's what they could.  It's already happened.
I'm not tossing FUDD and no need to be insulting.
Can you back that statement with a verified source?
Do I need to this second?  I mean there's this thing called search engines on the internet
Not being insulting, I just know there is tons of misinformation out there.
You're certainly coming off that way
Rather than rely on random internet stuff go to the source.  That is what security professionals do.
I posted them above imjustice
Then use it if you're so confident then
Greetings from Utah
All my personal messaging is via signal
Good for you.  I've been working in CS for years, but sounds like you think you know more so go for it.
imjustice I will paste again
Signal security settings - 
main menu -> Settings -> Privacy

Turn on:

Screen Lock
Screen Security

Set Inactivity timeout to something not too big.  Mine is 1 min.
imjustice what did you do when 60 minutes showed up?
That probably means you do not have any password set on your phone.
You will need to set a passcode
we talking cryptography?
I do not think signal works with fingerprint for a good reason.  Fingerprints can be forced.  There are places in the world where they will not think twice about cutting off someone's hands so they can run all 10 prints on a phone without any struggle
imjustice you want something you can remember that will be hard for someone else to guess
birthdays/ham callsigns/aircraft tail numbers all bad....easy to guess if you know anything about the person.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=b247XA5onY3L8GkiX) America's never going to become one of those places!
Well then willis4play I suggest your fork your own version of signal and make it work with fingerprint readers
Houston, TX - checking in
But remember in the USA they can force you to use your fingers and face to unlock your device.  They just can not damage you in the process.  That went to SCOTUS
Pretty to do face recognition without hurting someone, and with the right restraint technique they can get fingerprints.
Pretty easy to do face recognition without hurting someone, and with the right restraint technique they can get fingerprints.
imjustice what happened with 60 minutes?
Spooks got the biometrics lifted from the company that verified OBL's identity ... they can get mine lol
jbhouse that sounds like a good plan
Never far from me imjustice
As with the revolution these things must be handled on multiple fronts and things must come together on many levels.
That's the kind of thing I'd rather not talk about, online.  Imagine anything we say being on the front page and skewed to fit the new normals narrative...
AZ needs to happen. And now NH needs to happen - it may happen before AZ
Stewart sent a nice short piece to national leadership that answers that question imjustice.  I know he is tied up with something right now, but I will ask him to post it to the web site.  Effecting the right change requires multiple paths.
Y'all hmu if you need me I gotta get back to this cyber security course im working on.  :ok_hand:
IE checking in.
Which comms app?  Everything went silent for a while so I quit checking...  I still haven't heard anything official and I am kind-of wondering if this is legit myself.  If this doesn't pan out, I'm with you on striking out.  There are plenty of worthy causes out there for my monthly contribution to fund.
Time check.
What will happen in about seven months, when the news will be filled with stories of miscarriages, birth defects, SIDS, and the MSM will be tripping over themselves to make sure that the VACCINE is NOT TO BLAME for this sudden change in human reproduction?

I am one who obeys the law, but I can tell you ... if half a dozen corrupt politicians were found hanging from trees in front of their homes with NO ONE knowing how they got there, the remaining corrupt politicians would tuck their tails and BEHAVE!
Signal, I did not want to say it publicly, for good reason.  I was in two groups with you. We were set to meet but the group lost contact with you and you were solo for the day.
LASZLO was in that unvetted group too.
I would advise getting a Proton email account so we can talk more securely
Hello Austin
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/NC?msg=ttCABZfrjWaFeRmNK) Warlocknc@protonmail.com.  thanks man....appreciate it
Im in western nc...close to tenn
Ijeh heh!!!I'm in eastern standard
The best way to connect with other Oath Keepers is through this forum, but if you want to connect with other like-minded Patriots to build up a local group, this is a powerful tool you can use. My Patriot Network is a forum that connects people on the Global, United States, State, and County levels. I'm the Administrator/Organizer of MPN for North Carolina. My goal is to establish a strong coalition of citizens on the LOCAL LEVEL, which is one of the strongest initiatives that Oath Keepers has promoted. MPN and OK are aligned completely on this. MPN is a bit hard to figure out at first because of its structure, so I'm going to include here a list of procedures to follow once you join MPN.
MY PATRIOT NETWORK (MPN) is a bit confusing until you realize that it is set up as a hierarchy: a main group divided into sub-groups, with each sub-group further divided into sub-groups.

First step upon joining MPN is to select the main group ‚ÄúGLOBAL PATRIOTS UNITE.‚Äù Once you click on the JOIN GROUP button, it will change to a YOU‚ÄôRE A PATRIOT button. Do not click on that button again unless you want to un-join that group. 

The GLOBAL PATRIOTS UNITE is important because there are people in other countries that support our fight to maintain our Constitutional Republic. They know that if we fall, they will fall soon thereafter. This allows members to access their communications. Our experiences may be of use to them as well.

When on the GLOBAL PATRIOTS UNITE page, scroll down to just below the group description and you will see a horizontal bar of menu selections. Select the SUBGROUPS. Go down the page until you see the subgroups listed at the bottom.    You will need to click on the box ‚ÄúAll types‚Äù and within the drop down select ‚ÄúMPNS‚Äù in order to find the UNITED STATES subgroup and select that. Join.

Repeat the same process as above. Go down, select SUBGROUPS then click on the box ‚ÄúAll types‚Äù and within the drop down select ‚ÄúMPNS‚Äù in order to find and select NORTH CAROLINA. Join. 

Repeat the same process. Go down, select SUBGROUPS, then select MPNS, then select your county. Join. If you do not see your county listed, post on the North Carolina forum that you are from a county that does not have a County Group page and I will make you one. 

If you want to be active in your county to herd Patriots to your county group and to keep conversations on track, click on the MODERATOR APPLICATION link provided in the description text in your county group. It may take a few weeks before you get a reply.

In the mean time, at the bare minimum, please monitor the NORTH CAROLINA forum for timely information. Every now and then you will see that there is very interesting information about events in a another county. Our primary focus should be North Carolina so that this MPN tool will help us become effective at making a positive change in our state. The greatest and most effective long reaching change always starts at the LOCAL LEVEL. If we can‚Äôt accomplish that, we can‚Äôt add to the success of other counties and states  to make a real and lasting change in our country.

I suggest you copy and paste this into a NOTES app in case this post disappears or gets buried in conversation.
Good Luck Patriots! We need UNITY to face the threat to our Constitutional Republic!

"That's the kind of thing I'd rather not talk about, online. Imagine anything we say being on the front page and skewed to fit the new normals narrative." -- @willis4play 

I wouldn't worry about that anymore, Willis. We're way past all that. Besides, the media will NEVER write a kind word about OKers.  Worrying about our PR and image, public opinion and polls was always folly. We're not here to win popularity contests. Doing the right thing is often unpopular, inconvenient, and costly. We're here to defend the US Constitution from enemies foreign and domestic. Expect false accusations, ridicule, and persecution. Expect to be hated, hounded, and hunted. That was the price our Founders paid. Our Founders weren't interested in PR; they were driven by a higher purpose.
They are trying to make us fear because they are araid of us.
Anyone out there from NJ?
I could careless what the media says .. I am on Mewe at Page AmericanUP!
Trash talk them every chance I get including biden
Actually I don't trash talk Biden I only speak the truth about what they are doing to the nation, now they are trying to change the social economic structure of our country with that little stunt trying to turn our nation into welfare state .. slowly .. https://www.theepochtimes.com/increased-child-tax-credit-paves-way-for-universal-basic-income-experts-say_3724806.html?utm_source=morningbrief&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=mb-2021-03-10
That isn't enough to make your blood boilI don't know what is.
Populist Nationalism vs Global Elitism
The integrity of the 2020 election appears to be a matter of debate among OKers. Some believe the election was stolen in a massive coordinated fraud, amounting to an election coup. Still others do not and look to 2024 as another opportunity to save America. The divide in our ranks is immobilizing an effective response.
A divide in the Okers? or around the nation?
A divide in the OKers.
Well, you are either for the constitution of the United States, or you are not. One can not have a patriotic duty and then be divided there are only traitors and patriots
The definition of patriot vs Traitor says so
OVER 600 Groups marxist groups are operating in this country .. over 50+ DNC members support these groups.. They cannot hold office, support an unamerican group, like CPUSA and stand there and tell me they are patriotic .. it's lie!
Based on chats posted to this forum before the cancellation, a significant number of OKers were not convinced the election was thoroughly and completely compromised. They look to the next election to turn things around.
Well, Okay so what you are saying is there is a divide between Okers over the Election Results, not the Mission?
Okers have no divide as far as the mission but they have a divide whether there was a fraud or not .. Well there was most definitely fraud I mean look at all the stuff coming out now@@@  LOL .. SCOTUS is unconstitutional and they need to go every one of them starting with Roberts!
The only reason they don't want to hear the cases now is there starting to look like idiots .. and they want to curtail the notion that they are idiots
Your thoughts
Keeping AZ I went to HighSchool in Tucson
There are other divides to overcome as well. The matter of PR, for one. Many well intentioned OKers are too concerned about OKer's public image.
Well, I agree image is important.  NOt as important as the Constitution of the United States. OR our Oath, I know I took an oath and I am very concerned about what is happening.
Hence My American UP page on Mewe
closing in on 500 Followers I have 450 on Parler and Bill O'Reilly is Follwing me closely and so is Tomi Lahren
Oh, thats one month.. I hope I can help the OKers by being a voice on American UP Podcast . it's small now but its catching
OKers and liberty-loving conservatives are independent cusses. Like herding cats. Washington had a terrible time maintaining a fighting force when he was commanding general.
How are you all doing?
Who was the commanding general maybe I missed it ?
https://mewe.com/p/americanup Welcome to come and join if you like there is the link :D
Only in the SCOTUS can a case go from being ‚Äúnot ripe‚Äù to ‚Äúmoot‚Äù overnight.
Isn't that funny you say that :D
Keeping AZ I'm out .. after reading a series of articles .. the founder is bad for coverage and will not honor his own group. That's sad! very sad. but the word is out amongst several disgruntled members including board members are seeing Rhodes as a person who leaves his post and does not stand by his Okers.  I'm out sorry to say!!!  Looks like all the money he makes from members goes directly to him and nobody else.
When it should be going to Legal representation and safeguards..
I am not going to belong to a group where I think they mean one thing but its founder is looking a bit wishy-washy!
Pharmaceutical companies have protection from lawsuits. Do their agents have protection from criminal prosecution?
Pharmaceutical companies if the case is strong enough they will send their own lawyers in to defend.. yes!
Is it safe to force people to increase their intake of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide by forcing them to restrict their breathing with a mask?
HELL NO I Haven't been wearing a mask since this shit started
I don't care what the CDC says and I certainly don't care what a politician says about it .. it's against my constitutional right to restrict my movements.  I have had the same argument with a police officer face to face .. when I said .. well I will just call my lawyer and you can discuss it with him hows that sound.  He went on his way!!!
It's a smoke screen!!!
There is nowhere in the consistution that says they can restrict your rights unless you are committing a Felony!!!!!
Good to see you got in Jim
Copy that and thanks
Jpj can you message me on the side anywhere?
Can you do that sir
jpj where would I see the message from you?
Private Chat
Set up a private channel jpj
how do I give you access
Well I had same problem but after a few tries I got it .
Give me a moment Drunumi.  In the middle with someone else.
No worries
What is up?
Well first thanks for having me I signed up well before Jan 6th finally got an email a couple of days ago.. so thank you for that
Next . I am little concerned about the division of the Group and I know you are admin so I thought I would ask . what in the world is going on?
We had tech issues.  We were totally down for about 2 weeks, then been building back up little by little
So this chat just came up the other day.  When you got the email to join is when this came back on line.
It's software I get it
I am techy
so I get it
I have not had time to monitor the chat much as I have been working on many other tech issues that are a problem since we were deplatformed.
ooooh .. part of the censorship crap
Not a software thing, was our previous hosting provider pulled down our servers with no warning and reformated the drives, so I was basically starting from scratch
So there are lots of upset guys on the channel.  SR has not been saying much on advice of attorneys.
Well hence the remark about censorship
SR is real busy right now, but I am pretty sure he is working on some message about how to conduct ourselves as we prepare the way forward, what ever that may look like.
Well, 7 or 8 articles out there really blasting Rhodes .. saying he is leaving his post .. not backing the people that are there for him. .. I don't want to offend you that is why I pulled you aside.. I am serious about my commitment and therefore I want to make sure I am into a group where if I do go somewhere I know the leadership is going to be there.
SR appears to be the subject of an FBI investigation according to an article today that came across my news feed.
OK has been sued in Federal Court.
I am an operational Marine. served 11 years.
When you are sued the first thing the attorneys tell you is SHUT UP.  Anything you say can be used.
SR is working with the attorneys to figure out what can be said.
Yeap .. nature of the best with legalities
Also SR has not tossed anyone under the bus and will not do that even though a couple of our dues paying members went off book and walked away from the mission direction. IE went rogue.
USN here.
Well, you got a guy by the name of Knowing AZ .. who  really should not be spouting off about division within Okers
Thanks for your commitment to the flag and country
You note I addressed a Jim when I came into General just before?
He is at the national level.  I made him a leader in General.  I expect he will do some ass kicking.
Yes .. I think I am understanding you .. you addressed a guy name Jim just before I came in
Jim .. is fine I made a remark about leaving I am not sure but now after talking with you .. there are levels .. there is the ground levels and higher levels and I needed to hear the higher level of what was happening and it makes sense
At the moment most of the national leadership are doing Triage work as a result of Jan 6.  I am doing the IT Triage and reconstruction.  I expect more OK leaders in the chat as the days go by and they will be talking to guys.
Like I said I expect more state and national leaders to be present in the chat as they get other things under control.
How does one become a leader?
In addition to dealing with the IT I am the New York City Leader, but NYC is such a small group I do not have any problem children.
I just fell into it.  Guy running NYC walked away a few years ago.
What state are you in?
I want to let you know I have a podcast called American Up  Get Up STAND UP American Up . and TEXAS
Mewe page is American UP  If I can help be a voice get messages out that sort of thing I will in code if need be
Parler . American UP is under DstephensUSMC
OK well there are good guys in Texas.  Jim (donaldson) is covering the higher level stuff in Texas and much of the southern tier.  Reach out to him and ask how you can help.
Soften the blow for me reach out to him and let him know I am coming
We have a good man in El Paso that will be showing up in the TX Channel soon. He leads stuff in El Paso
Well I am in Dallas Area
Just click his name and private message him.
Thanks for your time
Or hang in the TX chat
No worries.  Glad I could help.
Well connect with me we can chat more
et1ss_ret you know what DBF means?
My Pop was Chief ET SSN, but preferred diesels and finished his sea duty on the last diesel
jpj reached out to me nice to meet you US MARINE here in Dallas TEXAS anyway I can help?
Zumwalt would not let me into Nuke Power School, so no sub school for me.  Sadly I was stuck on the surface so did not stay.
Thought the darter was the last?
Dad's last duty station was in charge of the LA Class simulator at Groton.
Glad to see so many in Texas checking in.
I have one of those Tees my dad gave me when I went away to school.
Thought it was Darter at San Diego, but could be wrong.
Darter was used as Target Practice.  Found that on the web.  I know in the 1980s she was still at ballast point.  Kept track of her for a while.
You are in the city Joe
You in Staten Island Joe?
We here in NY have it hard, but we have to start pushing back on the political front.  NY Dems have never been challenged.  We need to make that a point to do every time they go to the stupid drawer.
Hey guys! Windy (Army vet) here, from Pueblo, Colorado. Just joined the Oath Keepers last summer. Happy to meet you all. Hoping we can make a difference here.
I'm not sure I get what you are saying.  I remember clearly what all happened, but I too was in a few groups online, so I was just curious which "comms app" you was referring to since there was the Zello, Signal, Rocket Chat, and Telegram apps all being used by different groups at the time.  What happened to LASZLO and law2187?  Law2187 basically came back and told me I could start my own group because there wan't anyone else in my area...  Not exactly what I expected to hear from a group that is supposed to be as large and organized as OK
Ahhh....I knew a few years ago we had a NYPD member who lived in SI, 2 actually, and were stationed in Brooklyn.
@jbrown1118 Totally agree
@jbrown1118 Totally agree
@jbrown1118 So, any ideas why its not happening yet?
@jbrown1118 You're right
@jbrown1118 Nice to hear some truth for once
@jbrown1118 Absolutely. That takes some courage in itself
@jbrown1118 Yes. I am truly hoping we here can be the ones to move it to the next step
@jbrown1118 Same here in Southern Colorado
@jbrown1118 I am. Feel free to connect with me at krissyramsey@protonmail.com  I'm happy to privately network with you on forming a resistance
@jbrown1118 Thanks. I'm trying to figure out how to use the PM now. Will reply asap
Hi. Thanks for connecting with me. My real name is Krissy. An honor to meet you
I'm a 59 year-old female Army vet in Pueblo, Colorado
@jbrown1118 Got it, replied
Happy to work with you in forming a resistance movement
Thank you. Are you getting my PM's here?
@haphazard Amen, brother! I'm with you and @jbrown1118
@jbrown1118 Are you getting my PM replies?
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=Sy8SSmXmsY7q5KHqN) Agreed
Checking in for the first time since OK was deplatformed.
This is an exact repeat here of what was said and what went on before the previous site was de-platformed, only some or most of the faces have changed.
That's exactly what I'm saying
the exact same conversations went on for weeks, months and there would be one or two people that were "in-the-loop" that would drop in saying things were going on behind the scenes and to hang in there
I suspect this is playing a part in why it seems nothing is getting done..... Much like us, they don't know who they can trust and who is a plant.  This whole thing is going to take a while to iron out.... https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/stewart-rhodes-oathkeepers-capitol-riot/2021/03/09/2c3d7fd8-808a-11eb-9ca6-54e187ee4939_story.html
Silverhammer you hit one of the big points.  This chat is unvetted.  So it has to be treated like a public statement.
Our wonderful OK website editor just sent this to me and suggested I read it: https://amgreatness.com/2021/03/09/choose-your-ground/
Hello Patiots!   Greeting from Flagler county!
@n8186w Wow! I'm for creating the alternative state
@donaldson Interesting. You may be right.
Hey @bravo-echo Some things never change right? Lol
I was involved with a guy going by law2187, before the site got shut down, going through the vetting process.  He was allegedly the TN Chapter President.  Is that still the case, and what is the status on vetting in the state of TN?
John - Flagler
@jpj Hi. Nice to meet you. Looks like good info there. Just getting up to speed on how the forum is working
You need to post to #general for me to promote you.
Post anything even Hi from mars.
Hello Patriots!! -- from Flagler Florida
TN leadership should be in the TN room now or soon.
Hello from NYC
So... has crazy JSC come back or did he go and get hisself incarcerated?
Has anyone heard from, or responsible for, the leadership here in TN?  I am curious what the status is on the vetting process.
@1984isNow You're right. 1984 is now. It ain't going back to normal unless we take it back
Hey @zhod Colorado here
Windy, read a bit of the conversation earlier and I have to agree that on the right it's just a lot of complaining and no action.  The left is highly organized, funded and unfortunately has immunity from the law.
Guess I'm saying taking it back is easier said than done
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/FL?msg=zswpWroYwPSFCS4KW) Send me email to get plugged into State chapter --- FL@OATHKEEPERS.ORG
Should I make you leader of the FL room too?
@1984isNow don't forget backed by the lame stream media
@1984isNow Will do. I figured that was the case. Everyone here in Colorado was laughing at Antifa. I knew they were far a far more dangerous threat than they were giving them credit for
YES PLEASE -- AND THANKS
If so pop into the FL room and post a hello
Then I have to run some errands.
@bravo-echo, yeah you're absolutely correct.  They do control the narrative as well.
Having an issue with fl but now that you have posted there I should be able to make it happen
He Haw!
It's all good -- run errands.    We can finish up later
There you zhtod you now lead FL
Done....had to post myself.
ATTN -- All that are actually living in Florida!!!     
Send me email to get plugged into State chapter --- FL@OATHKEEPERS.ORG
Thanks again
No problem
Just to remind old-timers, or enlighten you new-comes, wherever you fit in... a blast from the past: https://popularresistance.org/oath-keepers-private-chats-show-desire-for-post-election-violence/
so, maintain situational awareness and mind your bees wax
Hi @hardcoreconservative Good work! Southern Colorado here. I don't know of the Colorado Militia group you speak of, but my question is, how do we know the source and intel is reliable? We need to be wary of psyops, and vet any intel with the same scrutiny as we vet our members. If I know one thing about Antifa, I know they are masters of psyops
@haphazard Yes
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=4MzQm4tJdbWysdyBa) Thanks! Always
*****ATTENTION ON DECK*******
Just in from SR.  Just sent me a PM.
@dancoate HI Dan! I salute you for stepping up for our country!
He is tied up dealing with an issue involving some members but he will be in this channel this evening to brief us.
@jpj Great!
Any idea what time?
He did not say yet.
Just stay tuned.
Can confirm
5/5 ty
Hmmmm not working at the moment.  Give me a moment Nathan
No prob
Good deal
Field promotion complete
Ty sir
I might work up a tutorial video for new folks tonight 
With screen cap video, then edit it up on the pc
Greetings Humans.  Can anyone point me to a group in southern Wi?
ddrager (and anyone else interested) ==   you must click on the globe above left and then scroll to your state, then message in there.     BE ADVISED -- this forum ("Rocket Chat") is just back up recently and many are still in process of getting back on here.     BE PATIENT.  We will get you plugged in.
Greetings fellow Wisconsinites. New here.  An groups in Wi that meet up regularly?
Yeah this is great to see
Anyone know if the OathKeepers T-shirts are ever going to be available to buy again?
Any idea what time?
Finally got this thing to work.. Yo
It‚Äôs going to be a real shit show in CA. Almost everyone is pissed, and even fairly liberal people have had enough and are doing their best to arm themselves.
Down near Cincinnati
Hi again! Nice to be back , for however long this lasts. I found lots of problems with outside attacks against the email servers. I doubt that will ever stop
attacks against email servers are normal for all western world email servers
Hey, nice to be able to talk with more OK's again. How is everyone?
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=hc4euErZcP6bchvtA) Anyone wanting a ConCon, Constituional Convention, should be shot.  And I don't mean that figuratively.  First off any numb nuts that thinks a ConCon is a great idea has zero concept of the process.  First off Constitutional Conventions is how we edit the US Constitution, however, when that was drafted and used, we had honorable MEN, that stood for something greater.  Now all we have is a bunch of commies in leadership positions and any tampering of the US Constitution right now and we'll see our rights trampled and erased.
@Shooter-OK-NH Your totally correct. Despite all the talk of exhausting all peaceful options, this won't be settled peacefully. We are way past that point. There is either going to be enough of freedom-lovers willing to unite and fight for our rights (while we still can!) or we will have a total AI-controlled one world government with China at the helm.
@dad-33 Outstanding, sir. There is hope
Do you know if SR is going to be on tonight yet?
He told me directly he would.  He did not give any time.
@notanonymous I definitely understand your point, and it would be nice if it were possible. I just feel it will be too little, too late if it doesn't happen very quickly. We may not have the numbers to prevail, but the fact remains tjhat we're up against the Chinese at this point, and the only thing they will understand is force.
To make sure everyone knows what I know here goes: SR will be in this chat tonight with a message for us.  I do not know when.  He is dealing with a situation which must be wrapped up before he joins us here.
Copy that
The chicomms graciously offered to the WHO that they would like to manage the worldwide virus passport system. What nice guys
@andyjack Aren't they nice...lol
Saw that coming
@dad-33 Yes, I agree
@dad-33 I do pray that you're right there. What they want and what they are willing to die for are two different things. Either way, they'll soon be forced to make their choice.
The problem is not the news. The problem is that 80-90% of the population are idiots and will blindly believe anything according to their political/idealogical/philosophical/ignoramical bent
did I say that?
@bravo-echo Lol, you're right!
You here?
Apathy is our biggest adversary in my humble opinion. Once they start actually coming door to door that will change. What I am curious about is who is going to come door to door because not one cop ive talked to said they will do it. For a lot of reasons.
@andyjack Yes, apathy may be the root of it. Not sure there's anything we can do to fix that. Interesting to here about the police being unwilling to enforce the final destruction of our freedom. It would be nice if they would speak out publicly to that effect. At least through their union or something.
County sheriffs are sworn in under the same oath we took to protect the constitution....city police are ""policy" enforcers  for the city...if you have a strong keft city...the poluce will b
Im all ears
The police will lean that way most likely too
Seems like fear and intimidation are their weapons right now. They are gathering info for sure right now and maybe have a plan but it may be a heavy haul for the bastards
@dad-33 So true, the brainwashing going on is immense
Your mistaken if you think there are no liberal police officers.....
Yes they are trying to vet the military right now. Weed out the patriots. Same with police forces I suppose.
Lot of it going on in liberal states with the national guard.....whole units led and mentored by left leaning  commanders....
My town is very rural as well..everybody's packing....signs in the store say ....we welcome you to wear your side arm...
Its a can of worms but since giving up isnt an option we need to figure it out.
Send a message in your state(s) asking for guidance (click on globe upper left sidebar, then find your state chat room)
State leaders are starting to join and they looking to get to know folks.
As far as I know we are also in need of leadership/organization up in the Commy Corner (New England).  These blue state politicians are delusional.  We need to communicate, unite, and assert our convictions so these wimps will think twice about compromising on the Constitution!
Anybody else in here from Ohio? I joined the Ohio chat but very few people are in there let alone chatting. 
political positions should be like jury duty not a career
Please use your head when talking on here. Violent rhetoric is what they are looking for.
should be a disclaimer on the top of the page
I still have no more news on the SR brief than what I sent earlier.  He has something to tend to that must be complete before he briefs us.  We are in the sad position of having to deal with things the way lawyers wish since the lawsuit.
What lawsuit?
The one that has been in the news for days where Proud Boys, OK, Trump, others were sued by a member of congress under the anti-kkk law.  Google it.
Missed that
Oh wait congressman Swallow?
Yep , that's me
I saw the headline. Didnt think it was worth the read. That sucks
You need to start reading even if it is repulsive
I'm here -- more leaders to come soon.   This chat has some bugs to work out.    Did you send a message under your state chat already?
Swallowell lawsuit? That retard couldn‚Äôt litigate his way out of a paper bag. Hopefully, all defendants push for attorney fees.
@zhtod perhaps you should introduce yourself.
deja vu
For those that do not know I am 1/2 of the OK Tech Squad and I try to hold together the behind the lines operation in NYC which has precious few men.
Vetting? There is no such thing as vetting in OK. I was with the group that was supposed to meet you on that fateful morning in VA.
Law left the unvetted group on 2/19/21, without saying a word
So I left
Eastern NC?
I'm state leader / poc for Florida.
SR ON THE PHONE WITH ME NOW
HE is getting on now.
Moreover, I had sent him the info requested and documentation. I guess they have no vetting system since I never heard one thing afterward.
Salute, thanks for introducing yourself. I‚Äôm proud to be a part of this and I‚Äôm excited to hear what everyone has to say. 
If they want us to start local groups they ought to provide some guidance or at least the means or protocol for doing so. It's almost like flying by the seat of your pants!
Ears on
I am also the person that reached out to you on rocket chat and got you in the unvetted group and the state to state group on signal. Boy was I duped and used for naught.
Three men walk into a bar...
Definitely left a bad taste in my.mouth.
For all patriots new to this site, i suggest you each send a message on your state channel.    Once leadership gets back in, they will be checking their state to see if any new members need guidance into the individual state channels (more secure).
Greetings all, this is Stewart Rhodes.
Good evening all.
New member by the way. Looking to hear from the leadership once they are on here. 
Hey boss
Good evening sir. 
I joined a new group and paid for my own vetting (cost me nearly $30, what a racket, lol) but it happened in 2 days or so. I had to generate a report via intellius.com. it is somewhat comprehensive but not entirely accurate on some things. The big categories are the criminal records, as in not a felon or on a watch list or sexual assault registry.
Hey Stewart
HEADS UP!  We are in a legal fight right now, against the deep state and their Marxist allies, who are repeating the exact same gameplay as the Gestapo and KGB.   We are being subjected to a stalinistic purge/persecution campaign against patriots, and we are enemy number one.  Just recognize that reality.
I am working with our Jan 50-6 DC Op leader, Whip, and our General Counsel, Texas lawyer Kellye SoRelle, on a timeline of our activities leading up to the Jan 5-6 DC Op, and on those two days.  That will help all the Oath Keepers who have been arrested.  We will be stepping up to do the following:
This group is organized and doing great things already. The state lead is good. There are only 3 in TN right now. Basically, this is a group that formed as a result of the ttpo disbanding.
Secure c o m m s is a primary focus right now along with a mission statement.
1.  We will have our legal counsel and a third party create a legal defense fund for all our members who were arrested in relation to Jan 6 in DC.   I WILL NOT handle that money.  And this org will not handle any of that money.  I want no question of "where did the money go."
That's how we have done it in the past, and it works.
I refuse to be a part of "another" group that sits idly on the internet complaining all day about how bad it is and how to elect replacement subversives and kowtow to them over and over again.
We did promote the Rally Pay fundraising campaign for Jessica Watkins, and would be happy to promote any legal defense account/campaign set up by any of our members who have been arrested. Of course.    But now there are so many of them (unfortunately) that we think its time to do a legal defense fund.
In the past, we raised nearly 50k for a WWII veteran who was fighting corrupt state officials who were trying to take his home.  We advised him to have a friend set up a fundraising account, and we then promoted it.  We never touched a dime.   That's the best way to do it, and how we will do this now.
2.  Myself and our national team leaders, Mike "Whip" and Don Siekerman, will serve as witnesses for any of the defense teams that are already defending our members who have been arrested.   Our General Counsel, Kellye SoRelle, was with us in DC and is also willing to serve as a witness.
You all need to know that we also retained a criminal defense lawyer out of DC named Ed McMahon, who was referred by Gun Owners of America lawyer Bill Olson, who I have known for decades.
That's right.  But hold that thought a minute
Let the man (Stewart) talk
hang on gents.  Let me tell you what we are doing'
Unfortunately, because Ed McMahon is representing the org, he can't represent our members who have been arrested.  It would create a conflict.   BUT, he gave us the names of two kick ass attorneys who we are passing on to anyone who needs it.   We will need to raise money to pay for them/help pay for any attorney our people hire.
Unfortunately, we are being subjected to "law fare" and you can see that we face a combined force of FBI/DOJ and the mainstream media, and also politicians who want to use us as their boogeyman to justify trampling on the rights of the people.
But don't forget that ALL Trump supporters and ALL American patriots are their targets.
Any questions on the legal fight, ask them now.
As a State Captain for Patriot Guard Riders AND a Lifetime member of Oath Keepers .... I am CERTAIN I am on FBI/DOJ watch lists
Count on it.  But all patriots, and especially all military and LEO veterans, need to realize they are on a list as well.
Ill definanlty  chip in for our brothers...where and when?
I asked earlier in signal, but I'll ask here as well, of the folks arrested and being charged as being Oathkeepers, I heard many were not even members in good standing, or on the rolls of past/present members at all. Any truth to this, and if so, how many were actual members in good standing. (Don't need names, just curious on numbers).
I have always used the analogy of an iceberg.  All who are card carrying Oath Keepers members are the visible tip of that patriot iceberg among military and LEOs.  All who are like minded but don't join Oath Keepers are the hidden mass under the water.   Drives the bad guys crazy.
Good question.   OK, here we go:
Even the creepy uncle gets to come to thanksgiving man!
After what Wray said last week it was clear where we stand. But they have limited resources too.
Jessica Watkins is/was a member.   Thomas Caldwell is NOT and never was.   Donovan Crowl is NOT and never was.
We will post details shortly.   Still sorting it out
Kelly Meggs and his wife Connie are members.  The others arrested at that same time are not.
I don't have all their names at my finger tips.
What about those  that have flipped on OK?
I only have 2 questions for you Stewart, 1. What do we need to do to be officially recognized as a member, and 2. How can we tell the true members from the wannabe in here?
Josh James, who was arrested yesterday in Alabama, is a member.  He was the team leader on the PSD for Roger Stone.   Robert Manuta, who was also on that Roger Stone PSD, is also a member.
Membership number/card is a good start.
some of us never received anything....
Is there anything we can do to assist other than await where we can send $$?
Prepared speech?   I am typing this out off the top of my head.   I put our people first.  So I want their brothers to know what's going on with them.   You don't like it, hit the door.
But how?  I submitted way more personal info than I am comfortable with to someone who isn't even here anymore
State leaders will be vetting folks in their state and then I will be setting up state vetted channels.
That's been an issue, as for awhile there it was one person trying to keep up with pretty quick rise in membership
Who was making a name for himself?
Ignore the troll
Its good to know OK has our backs as long as we are innocent so thank you Stuart.
We will have yours
This is Kellye SoRelle (attorney) -- anyone wanna help me name the nonprofit? Gotta convert this need for defense into a social justice movement (non profits are supposed to be apolitical)
Ignore the piece  of  shit....beneath us
I am willing to jump in and help, but recognize that I need to be vetted before I can help vet others
Look, I am NOT happy that some of our men went off mission that day and went into the Capitol.  They made a tragic mistake that is now being used to persecute them, and also to demonize all of us.   I didn't want them to do that, and didn't tell them to do that, but they did it, and we need to deal with it.
That is a tough one....  I will be thinking about it
EVERYONE is innocent until proven guilty.  Period.  Which is exactly why I HAVE NOT and WILL NOT condemn any of them in public.   Privately, here among members, I will tell you I think it was damn stupid to go into the capitol for ANY reason because it gave our enemies a great gift of being able to attack us over it.   BUT, being dumb is not necessarily a crime.
Green Dragon Fund  Back to Founders roots
Thanks for the clarification Stewart, that lines up mostly with the scuttlebutt I'd heard.
Everyone keep it civil and do not just spout off BS or I will mute you.
@mollypitcher "Appeal to Heaven"
Aye captain
Let me state this plainly:   I think it was a mistake to go into the Capitol, but I don't think merely walking into the capitol, through doors already open, with no police giving you orders to leave, is a crime.
We can even have a flag @mollypitcher
I contributed to the jessica Watkins defense fund for that very reason.
Green Dragon Fund (Back to Founders/Sons of Liberty roots)
Everything I heard and saw, even in Alexandria, was gearing up and preparations for possible conflicts with Anti-fa and Proud Boys.  Not once did I hear anything about breaching the Capitol.
Piney Woods
@mollypitcher when you decide on name let me know and I will get the web/email/other tech rolling
@mollypitcher How about the Brandywine Legal Defense Fund...If the name isn't taken.
That's right.  Our clearly stated mission was to provide volunteer security to events, VIPs, and to protect Trump supporters in general, as we have done on two prior DC ops (Nov and Dec), and at the Stop the Steal rally in Atlanta.
Actually, we weren't preparing for conflicts with Proud Boys. Just Antifa.  We have never had a problem with Proud Boys on the ground.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=XvzC4aA8Fh6FPyDEA) Being "unvetted" at the time, we were all out of the loop and playing it by ear.  Some were spread out between OK and TPO
Franklin victim defense fund
On a name for the defense fund, I do like the Green Dragon Fund!  Great idea.
A fund to raise money to defend ALL patriots who are being persecuted by the left.   Not just Oath Keepers, but putting our men first, as they are now in the hot seat.
Let's keep brainstorming on names.
The Deplorable Defense Fund
How do we go forward?
However, I will say this.  It is disturbing and disgusting to see the extent to which the more mainstream "right" in this nation has run for cover and abandoned Trump's own base who are now being persecuted.
Hahahaha!  That's also awesome
I hate to say it, but the Republican establishment is complicit with the corrupt Left
Nathan Hale Defense Fund!
The rinos need to be excommunicated from the republican party first. And it needs to happen quick.
it was a cluster fuck.  And I admit I got caught off guard.  I had no clue any of our men were going inside, and it didn't even cross my mind that any might.   My mistake. and it won't happen again.  We will be tightening up our command and control considerably.   That being said, being dumb is still not a crime.
That's assuming our vote has any value or power left
Trump is leading the way but we all need to work on it.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=LQbmLt3hhzxRpBApj) Thanks  I just feel we are at a place that's a historical repeat and we need that same vision, resolve, support  and inspiration
We will see what those who entered present as their defense.   I expect them to say "hey, the doors were open, and nobody told us we couldn't go in, so how would we know we can't?"
That was most info on jan 6th..that we have gotten from anyone....im honored to receive it!
Or, that they went in to render medical aid or to assist LEOs who needed help getting out.  We shall see.
Took me a while to get the tech up and running after the left deplatform.  Sorry for the delay
What I do know is that was no damn insurrection.
Based on photos and video; police waved people down and invited them inside the capitol
I do tech for a living and am more than willing to assist if you need.
It was a herculean task. Well done despite the delay.
That was simply pissed off patriots demonstrating.   A "mostly peaceful" protest is what I saw as I stood outside and watched.
We all are....apologies!
Any tech folks that want to help email jpj@oathkeepers.org
Exactly right.  Vastly differently, especially if we actually planned to conduct one, which we didn't.
people in this forum went on their own for lack of guidance coming from the top. it's begun again already...
The left/deep state is trying to manufacture a fake crime, a fake conspiracy, to carry out a fake (UNARMED!) insurrection that never happened.  All so they can use it as their "Reichstag Fire" event or new 9/11 to justify making war on all patriots.   We see right through it.
I hope my messaging you directly isn't considered out of place, but I do want to help.  If you can help me get set up with the resources needed, I can help with vetting to help ease the burden.  I also am a HAM operator so I can assist with comms when needed as well.  I am a network engineer at a university and I stay in emerging technologies for communications.  I don't necessarily deal with servers or computers, but did so a great deal working my way up to where I am over the last 20 years.  With any luck, my supervisor will be successful at putting me in the CISO seat in the coming months and I can bring my experience to the table to help with OK cybersecurity.
I sent you an email from my protonmail address.
You saw you were named in a WaPo story out today?
Understand that our lawyer, Ed McMahon, advised us to clam up and make no further public statements about Jan 6 and give no further interviews.   But we can't be silent.   I respect him greatly as an awesome lawyer.  And that's likely good advice most of the time, but I have an org to run and brothers to defend.
Really worried about a false flag. Really funny their seems to be no curiousty by the FBI about the Vegas shootings.
NO ONE BUT @stewart-rhodes or someone authorized by him should make any public statements.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=jEnxXYRTxwSjFKPjj) Yes, I saw that.   I know I'm a target.  Of course.  They want to shut me down.   But they will get to all patriots eventually.  Just a matter of time.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=jEnxXYRTxwSjFKPjj) yep.
me too
@jpj Ops Normal there.  No point taking any suspicion those in my office have and turn it into a bullseye on my back.
@alphatangocharlie Bergen County
Or my VP, Greg McWhirter.
The Deplorable Defense Fund
Let's discuss this.
Minute Men Money Pot, :)
Where do we go from here?   1.  Realize that this isn't a sprint.
Like Patrick Henry said, long ago 1. .  Recognize reality.  2.  Provide for it.
We were in a "sprint" after the Dems/Deep State stole the election. We had a rapidly closing window for Trump to man up and use his powers as Commander in Chief to do the mass declassification and data dump to expose all the traitors and compromised elites, as I had been urging him to do all year.
So, my focus was on that.  On getting Trump to invoke the insurrection Act and to use his absolute power to declassify ANY secret held by the CIA, FBI, NSA, etc.
And that was our focus between election night and Jan 20.   That was the point of EVERYTHING we did.
Sadly, he didn't do it.
But, that is part of Patrick Henry's timeless advice - to recognize reality.
Sad reality is, the bad guys stole the election like this was a Banana Republic.   They stole not only the Presidency, but also the US Senate majority by stealing the special elections in GA.   You need to recognize that there is no such thing as a clean election in this nation anymore, and their won
Makes sense, last I talked to him was on 2/4 when he told me I could start my own group
There won't be a clean election when there are electronic voting machines, and corrupt officials and corrupt and complicit judges.
Until you have paper ballots again, you can't count on any election being clean.
Not only did they steal the election, but cowards and traitors within the GOP were IN ON IT, and helped protect it.   There are still some legal challenges, and they are worth supporting, but I see it like this - they are really only worth supporting because they help us expose the crimes in the court of public opinion, which is what really matters.
Our election system failed to stop the steal.   then the politicians failed to stop the steal.  Then the courts, including the Supreme Court, failed to stop it.
So now what?
Now we walk the Founders' path.  That's what.
Get rid of rinos first
Support AZ and NH audits
clean our own house
Comms check,  Can you see what I'm typing?
Slightly off topic, but interesting none the less, recently found out Australians are required by law to vote in every election. If they fail to do so without proper excuse, they are fined and if that's not paid, ultimately jailed. Perhaps we should be floating this idea to congress critters as an alternative to voter ID.
No thanks.  I don't want to be compelled to participate in a fraud.
we are in a parallel to what the Founders faced.
Just found it interesting, and would never pass bill status. The debates would be epic though.
You know where the door is. See ya.
they faced:  1.  a foreign power where they had no representation, who  2. ruled over them through domestic puppets they had no control over, passing what they called "pretend legislation" and violating their natural rights.  And, 3. A massive international corporation called the East India Company that had special grant of power by the government to do as it pleased .
I do want to help. If you can help me get set up with the resources needed, I can help with vetting to help ease the burden.  I have run my own private investigations business a number of years ago, and worked in IT / informations secrity for 20 years.  I also am a HAM operator so I can assist with comms when needed too. I am a network engineer at a university and I stay in emerging technologies for communications. I don't necessarily deal with servers or computers, but did so a great deal working my way up to where I am now. With any luck, my supervisor will be successful at putting me in the CISO seat in the coming months and I can bring my experience to the table to help with OK cybersecurity.
There is no ‚Äúdelete account‚Äù option, retard.
Sounds familiar
No one forced you to come into this chat. You could have ignored said email, and left well enough alone.
this is why I choose not to eat corn flakes...
That's why I thought of Green Dragon.  History repeats itself.  Patriots are criminals
yes, indeed, it does sound familiar, doesn't it.
We are in a very near exact parallel.   We have a foreign power (China, international globalist elites, and the "Five Eyes" as an international deep state/shadow government.
I‚Äôm concerned with the time line of the path. They are rapidly doing everything they can to reduce this country to rubble. I fear that if something doesn‚Äôt happen soon this country is gonna to be screwed up beyond repair. Do you have any comments on this? What do you see happening? 
I joined as an associate member to find out what I could do during all the riots last year. Just want to know what to do now.
I am very new...and have been invigorated by having this contact of brotherhood ...thank you for speaking to us!!!
Yes, we are on the same path, but it is sped up.   The bad guys are speeding things up, but so is the reality of modern comms and travel.   Things happen faster.
Get strong.  Get strong as an individual, as a family, in your neighborhood, town and county.  Get strong at the local level.
@zephius Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
What should we all do in the interim???  RUN FOR LOCAL PUBLIC OFFICE
Rev Mike -- of course brother
Get strong locally, in all the ways that matter the most.
Well if there is anything I can do to help in the meantime. Please let me know. 
Very sound advise!
Hang on gents.
What did the Founders do?
We have to have quality people to replace the ones that get run out...
I agree with SR: Start local peaceful movements.  Get awareness out
A.  They resisted locally.  They got strong locally.
They took over their town and county governments.  They also raised town militia and minuteman companies.
They nullified locally. that means they practiced mass non-compliance.
My town is good..very rural...and very red.....i will volunteer as a election watcher tho and dare somebody to keep me out.....
Well ID10T holders would get sniffed out and trampled quickly, so that leaves the quality persons to fill said position
When General Gage landed in Boston Harbor, after the Boston Tea Party, one of the first things he did was to read a proclamation from the King, banning all town hall meetings.   The Crown figured that was the hotbed of the rebellion and if they banned them, it would die down. What was the Founders' reaction?
The Founders held town hall meetings anyway.
One of my hashtags that got me executed from FB ... #IWillNotComply
I know thats the truth. Fear and intimidation is their weapon
But, John Hancock and Sam Adams did not try to hold town hall meetings in Boston.   That would have been dumb.   They instead moved to Concord.
The patriots held town hall meetings in open defiance of General Gage OUT IN THE COUNTRY towns, where the patriots were strong, and Gage was weak
in fact, they held town hall meetings right across the harbor from Boston, in Salem, MA.  And Gage didn't do jack shit about it.  Now, why not?  Why was he powerless to do anything about it?
Tell me.
Public opinion
Or we have to have quality people to replace the subversive anti constitutional liars, thieves, murderers, criminals and communists when they ARE removed from office and the Republic is restored. To attempt to do this on their ground rules and their turf will turn you away or you will become like one of them. Their rules are anything goes and is manifested in how they conduct themselves everyday as despots. Few have the backbone to enter their arena and remain a person of character and integrity.
Ibe told people before.
Dont forget where you at
That was part of it. But not the whole answer.  What KIND of "public opinion"?
One man defending his home
Is more deadly than 10 trained soldiers
General Gage was essentially the military dictator over all of Massachusetts.  He landed with AN ARMY.
And yet he couldn't do jack shit to stop those town hall meetings.  Why not?
Nope.  Gage had no fear of one man
All together tho
Aha!  Getting warmer
One stick breaks
That's right.
Whole bundle is strong
And what was that "bundle" called?
Militia of the Several States
Well gentlemen I have to dip out as I have work in the morning. SR and everyone else, I appreciate you taking the time and I appreciate what you are doing. Proud to be a part of this. Good night and good luck. 
Goodnight brother
Thank you sir. 
in Massachusetts, in Salem, right across the water, where they held a town hall meeting in direct defiance of the King's decree, right under General Gage's nose, why didn't he just send across a dozen officers to arrest the leaders of that town hall meeting?
Sure, that's what they were branded.  But what were they?  Just a gaggle of people?
Give up?
They were armed and trained
Yes, patriots.   But again, just a group of patriots holding a meeting?
The fear of an organized militia kept Gage in Boston.
Yes!  They were armed and trained, and ....
Winner winner!  Chicken dinner!
Free men willing to die for the cause
That's correct.   milita
Gage couldn't do jack shit about an "illegal" and "banned" town hall meeting right across the harbor in Salem, because it was surrounded by thousands of armed, organized, trained militia.
I said the Militia of the Several States earlier! LOL
That's why.   At one such town hall meeting, there were 5,000 militia around Salem.
At another, after a false alarm went up, 15,000 militia responded from all the country towns.   Nothing happened, but it sent a damn clear message.
Yes, And a militia that was also smart enough to NOT try to march on Boston.   They let Gage be the aggressor.   They simply stood in defense of their brother patriots as those patriots held a peaceful town hall meeting in direct defiance of an unlawful order.
No threat.  Just clear competency and capability.  But I know what you meant
Think back to Bundy Ranch.
I AM (one of) THE VOLUNTEER MILITIA!
Why didn't Obama drop the hammer?   He could have used the military,   In fact, we know he considered a military option. Why didn't he?
I remember Bundy Ranch....thought of that while you were 'speaking'  LOL
the issue now is that the Feds are making a concerted effort to name every member of every militia with the help of Antifa and the main stream media and employing intimidation tactics to [fill in the blank]
Instead of them trying to find out what the American people will endure...
At Bundy ranch, Obama couldn't just do a "Waco" style takedown of the Bundy family. there were too many armed patriots, many of them military and LEO veterans, around the family to do that.
ALOT of pissed off civilians showed up on short notice ready to go toe to toe
Im out SR
The answer is still the same.   There is nothing new under the sun.  Human nature doesn't change.  The laws of physics don't change.
That's right.
HHonourspeaking with you, sir...warlock from nc here
Unite the Clans!
So, Obama couldn't just "Waco" the family, as we all feared they would, with some select SWAT team sized element, or even with a hundred FBI/ATF/DHS etc.
Couldn't do it.
He would have had to use the actual US military.  He would have had to use the Army or the Marines, or at least used drones or other air assets.
Goodnight brother.  Please DM me.
That was later.
It's an archaic term for Militia!
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=poh22j7Jnfvb2Bd55) Im here if needed...
Obama couldn't drop the hammer at Bundy Ranch, using military force, because he was seen as the clear aggressor.    He couldn't just use a raid size element, like is normally done to lone individuals, because there were hundreds of armed defenders, and many of them were prior service military and LEOs, and he couldn't use the military because he would have been seen as the clear aggressor and many of the current serving military would have turned on him.
Yes, indeed.  But also have discipline and discernment, and the humility to listen to the Founding Fathers, to learn their lessons, and to follow their gameplay.   It's a winner.
Again, nothing new under the sun.
The Founders didn't march on Boston as soon as Gage landed and read that decree from the King banning town hall meetings.
They instead DEFIED IT ,but did so out in the country where they were strong and he was weak.
They used mass NON-COMPLIANCE first.  But they also did so while surrounded and protected by large numbers of well organized and well trained militia.
red states-blue states
Same dynamics we saw at Bundy Ranch.  We had the advantage in numbers on the ground and we had the moral high ground.  We did not attack anyone. We only defended.
And the Obama regime blinked and backed off.
For those of us who are isolated and haven't been able to link up locally, where do we start and how do we keep safe?
There was a 'Cold War'  leading up to the actual fighting breaking out at Lexington and Concord.   The Patriots got ready.  They organized locally.   Both politically and physically,
I view this more as a history lesson than anything else right now
Again, nothing new under the sun.  It was attempted gun confiscation (and an attempt to arrest leadership) that kicked it off on April 19, 1775.
We have a sanctioned state militia here in AZ.  It;s just not active, organized or funded but it is LEGAL
History always repeats.  Question is will you listen?
I'm listening closely
Point is, we are in the same boat as they were, and the answer is the same.   They got STRONG locally, and united and as a united force of patriots, they formed town militia and trained, organized, and stacked not just weapons and ammo, but also food.
they got ready for what they knew was coming.
@zephius those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
Got to call it a night.  Morning comes earlier and earlier the older get...
Roger that
And they had the discipline and wisdom to let Gage be the clear aggressor.  they DID NOT march on Boston.  They defied Gage, thumbing their nose at him, and forced him to eventually come to them, out in the country where he was weak and they were strong
Let's continue this discussion in the morning gents.  Thanks for participating.
Thank You
Appreciate it SR.  Have a good night!
Thanks, have a good night
@stewart-rhodes It was good hearing from you directly.  It helped bring some perspective to what this platform is, and what the current state of affairs is.  I have sen you and others private messages offering support in my own way.  I am here if you need me, and will be supportive even when you don't.  Have a Blessed evening, sir.
But here is your homework:   Read Patrick Henry's famous Give me Liberty or Give me Death! speech.  Then answer me this question:   What was he giving that speech in support of?   It was in the assembly of patriot reps in VA.   Henry had made a motion, and gave that speech in support of his motion.  What was the motion?  What did he propose?
To be continued ....
Before the deplat, people in this group felt abandoned. It would be good if you, or someone you publicly designate could show up reasonably regularly to touch base with the troops, to provide some guidance. That's all I need to say. Hope you're well and staying safe. Semper fi, Chief.
And, can we get a round of applause for our IT crew for getting this system back up and running from scratch. üëèüëèüëèüëè
Keep the hashtag #IWillNotComply  handy
Night all.  I've got some reading to do
G'night troopers...
Good Night patriots
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=unUku7p86Pb0azlyN) Amen to that!
I divorced myself from this chicken-shit outfit over two years ago. I have the signed letter delivery to prove it. But I keep getting email to donate (to do what?), buy ammo at inflated prices and oh - now I have a new ‚Äúchat ID‚Äù with a password chosen by retarded monkeys.
Just making sure those dudes get the appreciation they deserve.
It's normally a pretty thankless job 
Yes indeed.  To be continued
I know you are busy, but if you happen to talk to the Arizona lead, would you ask of he's had contact from Tom Woody. I want him back as the State POC... lol
Hey folks, how you doing, glad to see things back up and running
Tom Woody, the guy who was ousted from Iowa
AMEN TO THAT!  So glad to see our forums back up and running after being down so long.   And our volunteer IT team made it happen.  Hat's off to them.  Salute! :flag_us:
Because Terry Spencer and Tom Smith were convinced they could do a better job. Then they both flaked out.
I am most humbled, and Ed is most in bed!
There was a big todo calls were made, you were there. Suddenly I was the sole Iowa Leadership position.
there was a rally here In AZ tonight. don't know if anyone else is here in the Phoenix area
things went off well, loads of patriots and veterans
I've stayed off the radar for the most part the last three months, last rally near the state house in Phx had loads of Chinese and ANTIFA doing recon
loads of people trying to photograph us and 3 percent, AZ militia
I was invited down to speak to a few groups about training them.
We have to start local training.
yes, but I think we must Vet members
have to now
I know we had informers and feds before
I've had a few members vanish in AZ I was concerned about, given their knowledge and intel gathering abilities, and having no apparent Federal,local LE experience, no military exp, supposedly
then *poof* vasnish
not like anyone was doing anything wrong, but it was obvious people were gathering Intel
got to build family and community through out the whole org
its the only way
Yep had an infiltrator in the NYC group who tried to entrap.
we didn't have anyone try to entrap here, but I was career Infantry, worked a lot with Spec Ops overseas, and 3 letter agencies. I can smell fed or Le from a mile away
Its been pretty clear they were setting us up for months
they are just very bad at their jobs honestly
Here tried to get guys to admit to having guns without permits or tried to talk guys into getting non permitted guns.  In NYC pretty much only the elite can get a gun permit.
when a guy with no experience shows up in the group and give me a stellar intel briefing on everyone in our org and others
Yep that smells
right, I know you have some horrible lawless laws up there
I have a good friend I served with for about 6 years in NY state
Sucks, but have to fight to change them
I don't think we can change much, doesn't mean don't try. I think at this point prep is it
pull together
I'd go as far as try to live close together, relocate if possible
build an actual community of sorts
the left is gonna move in lock step on everything, we don't have enough good people on the state and federal level to get a real impact, thats my fear
like here in Maricopa, Sheriff Penzone is a Soros pawn
the group Maricopa Strong is bought and paid for by Soros, that was the driving force in Sheriff P's election to office
Sheriffs are the key, Sheriff Lamb in Pinal is great, works with Cdr. Sawyer with VFCR
Sheriffs have the real authority in counties
and Marshalls to some extent
Physical fitness is key to getting through all this, get in shape folks
get used to wearing your kit and PT in it
get your beans, bandaids, and everything else in order
I gave out ammo and armor to members who couldn't afford it back in Nov
got to
I've been through at least 2000 gunfights and several thousand combat missions in my career, Physical fitness is everything
get lean and hard
its much harder to sit on your rear and do nothing
put on a pack, load it up with weight and just walk
burn all that fat off
my neighbors see me every morning in my kit and multicam rucking my ass off
and they just honk and wave
Ive even had afew liberal neighbors tell me as I'm watering the lawn and trees, were glad your here, we sleep better lol
yeah, some liberals are just in it for stupid stuff
they arent stupid
I mean some are clearly unhinged
but most are just soft and silly
there are loads of people that just vote their BS feelings, not the good of the country as a whole
I dated a woman that works in the house of reps for about a year
shes a Dem, works for a Dem Rep, but she agrees on everything we do, she is just caught up in identity politics
even took her shooting and she loved it
got her shooting 3 inch groups with a 45 1911 at 25 yards
and she was blown away how good she felt
I introduced her to other Oks and 3 per's and she was like you guys are heros
I was like you, you believe the hype now? were traitors and insurrectionists aren't we?
Well, Jan 6th was executed well, I have to hand it to whoever played on people's pasion
I think it was probably a PMC that provoked the violence
probably African in origin, executive outcomes is famous for that kind of work. I worked with them in Afghanistan
They'll take money for just about anything if the price is right
former Rhodesian, SA SAS,SBS types
I've seen them D-ring to Apache helicopters and fly in riding the sides of the cockpit
whenever we couldn't be there with no ROE, they sent them in
kill all, leave nothing alive behind
got to remember the other side has Veterans with training too, they will do anything for drugs,cash,women, precious gems. Trust me I've seen the PMC world, isn't pretty
check out Cdr. Bracken's work, military fiction, but it paints an accurate picture
anyone out there? anyone have any thoughts? or concerns?
anything we can throw out and help the org and the people here?
hey there,still up?
About to hit the rack.  How can I help?
your an admin, so obviously your part of the head shed
any chance you can put me in contact with some leadership in AZ?
Let me see who I have in the AZ room.  If one of them is in leadership I will let you know.
I'm the only member I know of in Arizona that actually pulls triggers for a livinfg
If not I will leave a message for someone to reach out
Where in Az?
I'm in the Phx area
I know of afew in Tucson that are good, just want to put things together here again. I know we had bad actors in the group here
I see no state leader checked in for Az yet.  Give me a moment.
I know there is leadership, just want to help and get things back on track
If all of that has dried up, I'm more than ready to take up that and get it rolling again out here
I've got another OK I've got in Tucson who is an AF security forces veteran, no combat time, but he knows his way around a weapon
theres no one else with my experience I know of here
Ok so I left a message for AZ leads.  They have not gotten their butts into the chat since I brought it up.
Yeah, to be honest leadership is pretty piss poor here
no real networking
zhtod while not in AZ is national management.
I was an infantry Plt Sgt
served with alot of famous vets
was in some of the worst fighting of the wars
I was a Navy button pusher.
Glad you made it through
its all good, I was in the Corps for 4 years, switched to Army, retired there
but I know the guys with BRCC, served with a bunch of CMH receipents
I know all the big names in the tactical industry, working on building a large tactical training facility here in AZ
I ask because no one here in AZ seems to want to push and train
I am away from the computer most of tomorrow and maybe Friday.  I have a boat delivery to prepare for.  Boat is not seaworthy and my job to get it up the coast in 60 miles of open ocean in the next two weeks, so I may not be around but I will keep agitating state and national leaders to reach out more on the chat.
okay, I'll be patient, not really in a old grunts nature, but thanks. I know your deep into things
I have to rack out.
we have the chance to build a real team here, don't want to miss the opportunity
peace brother, anchors aweigh! sleep well
welcome back
Idaho, great fishin
Yut yut where can we fund?
hey there
Where you from?
hey there
your in kentucky?
hey where you from?
hey where you from?
Yeah I agree, I was with the 4th ID in the Springs for awhile
served with a ton of CMH receipients there
sorry, I'm and old grunt my spelling sucks
Pueblo is a great place, love the river walk
still have that great Italian place there?
Cool, glad you know the area
great calzones and pizza
Yes, they do have that!
yeah, I lived off garden of the gods when I was stationed there
I love Colorado, to bad the Libs took it over
Bloomburg money
your female? Correct?
Beautiful area there in the Springs too. Yes, the libtards rule the I-25 corridor, but its seems pretty Red everywhere else. Kind of a weird mix, but the commies definitely have the upper hand here for the moment.
its Denver gov, and yes the state is definitely red
I actually haven't lived here that long. I'm from Chattanooga, Tennessee. Came to Denver in 2019 for a job opportunity that got dashed by the "pandemic" BS
I'm from the south too
Dixieland where I was born, look away,look away
American by birth, southern by the grace of God
Cool! What part? Kind of got stranded here after that. Definitely didn't want to be in Denver after that, basically surrendered to Antifa/BLM running it
Toombs county GA, I was born in Augusta
Awesome area there in Toombs County. Loved driving through there to get away from things
Do you still have family there?
Yeah, grew up in Vidalia and Lyons
most of my fam lives out in county land now toward Lyons
I can't find anyone here wanting to organize
and near Atlanta
thats okay, its that way everywhere
it will rebuild
I need to go back to TN....lol
your female?
59 year old divorced woman
bless you, we have few lady liberty types now
your still young
ill be 42 soon
just train and get in good shape
im like 80 going on 42
my body is pretty broken on the alter of freedom for Iraq's and Afghan's
but I'm okay
That's a great age, but yes, I live every day to the fullest, with the cards I've been dealt. Lucky to still be in the game...lol
Just a babe
Old babe
I'm honored to know you
but you are lucky Pueblo is good
Thanks, I'm trying to make a go of it
you are neck deep in NWO there
oil, masons
alot of bad juju there
Yes, but I am planning to move to a rural homestead near Trinidad, with a friend who bought the land
the I25 corridor is evil
If you want to see bigfoot by Trinidad I'll take you
I hunt near there
I've seen them up close
its a big ape
its a very large ape
seen them many times with witnesses
I'll take you up on the bigfoot tour...lol
its a very large monkey
I'm interested in that kind of stuff
its real
I know there's a lot of wild history there
the first time i saw one, I had witnesses
I would love to see one
I had just retired from the army and took my folks up
Sounds wild
we saw one chasing dear 30 yards away
came right up to my mom
They have them in Georgia too, I hear
she or he was scared of us
looked me and my mom right in the eyes
Understandably, they don't want anything to do with us humans
my mom looked at it and said we wont hurt you, and it ran down some deer for breakfast
I've heard they may be alien
my mom was face to face with it
I think its an ape from what I saw
Omg! What did she think?
I was about 20 yds from my mom and she was face to face with it
it looked at me, its an animal
like a huge ape
can run with deer just fine
just wish i had a camera
Yes, it would have been nice
but I swear its real
I never believed until I saw one
I know they are hard to catch photos of
but I know apes and monkeys, i've seen them overseas
I was considering joining a bigfoot search organization back in TN
its a giant ape
That's what it sounds like, but with more human intelligence
it has an ape face, and the shiny eyes for seeing in darkness
its a really smart ape
100 percent sure
Let's go find them! Sounds like a good adventure to take my mind off the NWO
its not alien or missing link, its just a huge powerful monkey
watch missing 411 on netflix or amazon
Super cool that you got to actually be with one of them. What a unique experience.
im sure they are real after what I saw
it was about maybe 10 seconds, my mom,dad,my kids,and myself
we all saw it
my mom could have touched it
There is so much out there that we don't understand. You should write an article about it for one of the paranormal investigation jounals
With an artist to draw it
As you saw it
psssh why, no one would believe
They may
Is you Mom still with us?
She must have been freaked out
yep all are
That's great
nah, shes a HUGE Christian
It always helps
she just looked at it and said Im not gonna hurt you
then it looked at me, we locked eyes
then I ran after the deer for breakfast
yeah it was really look
What else can you do after that experience
I still train and hunt
teach clients firearms,tactics,martial arts
but it was a big monkey
That's awesome. I would love to know more when you get a chance. I'm going to have to hunt with this homestead deal.
and it was a obvious HUGE monkey
about 7 ft tall
could bound in huge steps
jump like 6 to 7 ft verticals and keep up with deer in full gait
I'm picturing it. That makes sense it being a big monkey. Its interesting that they live in the Southeast Colorado, where there isn't much tree cover to hide. Never hunted before, can you believe that....lol
I could tell it was afraid of us to some extent
confused maybe
Would you have shaken hands with it or let it touch you, if it wanted to?
nah, it was wild
curious but definitely wild
They are definitely amazing animals then
If you buy near Raton in NM youll see one
I hope to explore the whole area eventually
they eat meat, and have eaten humans
i wouldnt mess with them
No, I'm a frady cat. I would probably be heading the opposite direction if I ran into one...lol
apes and monkeys do eat meat
I wouldn't shoot it, though
people miss that sometimes, this thing will eat you
if its gonna eat me, ill blow it apart
I believe that!
I have a feeling I'm going to be eating a lot of rabbit and coyote
i researched after my sighting, turns out they are all over Raton and northern NM and southern CO
I know what I saw
I will be keeping an eye out for one. I'll tell my friend about it. Maybe we can catch one on camera
after seeing the eyes, they hunt at night
None in AZ where you are?
early morning and night
they stick to the forest
Makes sense
I'm a believer, though I've never seen one before
if you want to see one, Raton NM from early day light
around Trinidad
you will find them
they are there
Thanks, I'll make it a point to scope out Raton
go deep into the woods around cokedale
It would be so amazing to see one
dont go unarmed or alone
youll be on the menu
I'm not going alone or at night though
id go with other guys I fought with
well armed
id love to try to see one again
Maybe it will happen
i think the one I saw was young or maybe a female
Your still a yougin
nah, but Im a well worn out youngin
im 300 percent on the books with the VA
Well, you sound like you're doing well, still active and hunting, training
loads of replacement parts
I can't imagine. But you still have a lot of living yet to do. Your journey is not over
well thats because I'm as hard woodpecker lips
most southern men are
Yes, I miss Southern guys. I'm kind of a redneck myslef
those yankees can't do half of what we do
No, they are all talk
No action
i could have marched southern women into Afghan and Iraq and we would have been done in afew years versus 20
The South will rise again!
No doubt you would have!
oh, I know
especially when you have a mama from the south
my mother, coming up on 80
has a shirt a got her, "only thing harder than a Marine is his Mother''
Yes, an amazing lady, I'm sure! My mom was from England...lol Survived two years of hard bombing by the Germans in Newcastle
Most people don't understand, what made the South great, was our girls and women, and why us men fight so fiercely for you
our families can't be beat
Her father was RAF, flight crew, shot down over Germany in 1943
I'm a true Southern woman
my grand dad was a flying tiger AVG and regular army in B25s in the pacific, and on B17s over Germany
God bless you my dear
Salute to your father
you have made the world richer
Your grandfather I mean
Thank you, I do my best
I served in the greatest decorated units in american history in the worst places
very proud of it
I know I can't let theirs, yours and your sacrifice be in vain
If I have any breath in me
its not in vain, they are in heaven
Yes, true
and we serve a loving God
Yes, I am a born-again Christian
duty is ours, the consequences are God's
Yes, so true to be reminded
so we do, and give honor to God
and if we die, so be it
we'll all be together again
To His honor I will die
if needs be
And yes, rejoined in heaven
what I always tell my friends who arent saved
dont take the mark
Many have already taken it
I dont believe the vaccine is the mark
What is the Mark?
the mark of the beast
the system
The microchip
It may be in the vaccine though
maybe, I dont think so
it will be bigger
They say its will be a mark on the hand
in the Bible
i think this is the alpha run at the mark
Yes, I agree
right hand or the forehead
Perhaps a digital tatoo passport
or RFID
or alien 2.0 chip
human 2.0
Yes, I ain't taking no mark at all
God says your beyond forgiveness
if you take it
which means your other than human
no longer his creation, reborn into darkness
The vaccine is mRNA, changes your DNA
yeah that bothers me
Very disturbing
but most vacs have done that
and you and I both have those, and we still choose Christ
This one is so experimental
its not it
but its coming
I live only by my faith in Christ now
as you should
do you have a good church there?
Thank you, my brother
No, not yet. My whole life has been waylaid by the pandemic restrictions here. Haven't been able to connect with anyone really
I'm gonna approach the leadership in Ok about a Christian channel
go online, loads of Christians out there, loads in here
maybe we should all get on and pray together
I am an ordained minister. I'm hoping to do some chaplain work at some point
make a channel
An Oath Keeper channel?
for Christians, people of faith
Great, I hope you can make it happen
I would love to see that
send a message and tell them too
Rhodes is a believer
I didn't know, but I figured he was
look at what he has posted
its all biblical
He seems God-ordained in his leadership
your ordained
go get it
I read his letters leading up to the election
tell them, lead some prayers woman
Yes, I want to do more in leading souls to Christ
be like Esther and Ruth
Yes, my heroes :slight_smile:
And Mary Magdelene
go get it, send an email, I'll back you
they know me
Thank you, brother!
I will
women can lead too
my hero on modern women is Joyce Meyer
ever read battlefield of the mind?
Love Joyce Meyer too! No, I haven't read it. I will now though. At the end of the day, I am but a lowly sinner, redeemed by the blood of Christ. I seek God's will in all things
try her and Joseph Prince
I will. I love Phillip Yancey books too
between her and Prince your walk with Christ will hit new levels
yancey is great
I can't wait to read more. Bible study is my life blood now
as it should be
all that matters is your walk with God and the men and woman around you
Yes, we need to continue our faith and prayers, no matter what
its all were taking to the next life
trust me, I've been dead before
I've seen the other side, God is real
only Lucifer is the accuser
I sense that you are a true testament to His grace
people don't realize, you are covered
literally in the blood sacrifice of Jesus himself
when you enter the kingdom of God, he sees you as Jesus
as if Jesus himself walked in the room
Amen. Beautiful. Our walk with the Lord will continue to grow, as with our meeting here
I am always here for you, if you need someone to talk to
believers men and women need to start believing, my daddy is a King
ya get it?
We should always give all thanks and praise to the Lord
your not asking the King for something, your asking your daddy
in all things, unconditionally
Yes, your daddy
Our daddy
i think some don't get it
the sacrifice and blood and all
Unfortunately, many are called, but few are chosen
true, alright, well you take , love you, blessing on you
Thank you, brother. I love you too. Stay well and may the love of Christ guide you in all your steps. Night night!
"But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God‚Äîhaving a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people." (2 Timothy 3:1-5)

For all the people in the IT department that got us back together you definitely deserve a standing ovation 
Good Morning Patriots!
I don‚Äôt watch mainstream media so I was wondering if what I heard about Texas activating the national guard to protect our border was true .. 
Is there any Reno Area Local leadership or Nevada State leadership here?
National, Regional, State and Local Command. We have to get the Organizing, the S.O.P.'s and R.O.C.'s as well as objectives, defined.
Yes, then pasting it into the message.
According to news reports, it is - since Biden will not lift a finger to fight the influx of illegals heading toward the border to become part of a permanent Democratic voting bloc
Good morning from Texas
Greetings SW Florida
Finally got in.   Its Will from Dawson County
Just here to do some admin work
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/FL?msg=CuXZ329DRhjWFeNxN) Good morning DK1472!    Email me so we can get you vetted / plugged into the state channels.      FL@OATHKEEPERS.ORG        Thanks, John - Flagler
morning Will
Good morning to you as well.
JPJ is the tech boss man.  He will be reviewing how to create a  new member report than has to pass it by Stewart for the OK in the next few weeks.
Ok as of now Jim and Moonshine should be moderators for this channel.  Jim if anyone else should be set as a moderator let me know but I am going to be away from the computer for the next 12-18 hours.  Have manual labor to do on a boat 2 hours drive away.
You can just let me know via private message on the other platform.
Brian told me media is camped out in front of Josh home.  Their email, phone and business lines are getting death threats.  He and his wife Audrey have 3 kids.  Hearing today, they are going to ask for bail.
I‚Äôll let you know. Appreciate your hard work!
Thanks for the info I hope Texas stands firm with this ... I‚Äôm in.
Good morning from Georgia
email sent!
is it worth following this chat again or are we still in the same place as two years ago, just catching up
Where do you think we were two years ago?
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=MduFZdJCRPsxm639j) There you go.  Though you are a bit of a "ringer."  I doubt many know that answer.
Yes, we do.  And we shall.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=fPqJTxXaEpMTGKxnh) Greetings.  This is Stewart.  Who is this?
I signed up a few months back and I still have not received my new membership package. Is this still something we are doing? Are we just behind cause of everything going on?
Yes indeed, it was.  And some of our guys got swept right up in it.  Just reality we now have to deal with.  As I said last night, it was dumb to go inside, but that doesn't make them criminals, not when they walked through doors already open (and some of the doors were opened by police).
I went to a rally wearing full armor for the first time. 61, 40 extra pounds, steel plates, thought I was going to die.
Will do jonrob2012!
I will reply with mine shortly. Yesterday was a long day and busy with some work stuff now. Stay safe and in touch
Likely yours got lost in the shuffle.  I'll make  sure our membership coordinator is in here, so you can DM him.
Awesome, just let me know who to talk to. Thanks. 
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=QerbHo3xOaLQWp7cn) Please remind me to put you in direct contact with Brandon, our membership coordinator.
Good morning all.
Will do sir. And thank you. 
About to do an interview with friendly media.
I'll jump back in here after, so we can continue our discussion from last night.
Greetings, I'm Krissy in Pueblo, Colorado. Joined OK last summer, but just now able to connect with you guys, due to the chat being down until recently. I am a 59 year-old female U.S. Army veteran (54C Smoke and Flame Specialist, Chemical Corps, combat support role 1980-1982 at Fort Hood, Texas). 

Originally from Chattanooga, Tennessee, I moved to Denver in 2019 for a job opportunity, only to see all my plans thrown into chaos with the "pandemic" crisis. Not finding any other nationalists in the Denver area, I moved to Pueblo in August to try to regroup and assess options for my next step. I've been holding firm until now, but my finances are depleted, the decimated economy here, and my unemployment having been exhausted in October. I am considering a move soon to Florida or Texas if things don't improve quickly on that front. In the meantime, I have some ideas which are still in the embryo stage, but am very isolated down here. I am still hoping to do my part in building the Colorado chapter. I am currently active on OK general chat. Feel free to PM, if you like. Hope everyone is hanging in there.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=k6z6ohCQ8zqHMe5af) [ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=jGwgwDvuzChNSpRjJ) Thanks for that suggestion. I just posted on the Colorado chat. Not much going on there, but I have volunteered to assist in whatever way I can.
How do you find state channels? Only thing I see is ‚Äúgeneral ‚Äú.
@stewart-rhodes And honor to meet you, sir. Krissy from Pueblo, Colorado. I salute your bravery and sacrifices in this fight. I joined OK last summer, but just now able to connect on the chat here. I have reviewed your update here from last night and joined the Colorado chat. I am proud to be a member and just  hoping to assist in any way possible, so don't hesitate to ask.
Greg Hutchins here from the Great city of Bowdon Ga! Nice to be a part of this wonderful group of patriots and friends!!!!
Anyone know if there is a Georgia chat?
Thank you sir
Hi Timothy! I'm Krissy. New member and an Army vet in Colorado. I salute your USAF service and your current sacrifice for the Republic. My father was career AF (2 tours of Viet Nam). Sounds like being on an FBI watch list is a badge of honor. Crazy, no? I didn't know it had gotten that bad, as I've been focused on career over the past couple years before the "pandemic," but you better believe I felt that Oath kick in HARD on 3/11/20! Just hoping there are more of us out there than it seems to this point.
Hello Fellow Patriots and Oath Keepers!! Finally figured out how to navigate a bit.....good to be among friends!!!
Carroll County
Good afternoon
Sorry Im lost......trying to figure out how to navigate.....
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=6WqkJMuLBFQBSTrz5) Great idea! Not sure if the woke Left is going to be too supportive of it, but how about "Just-US for Liberty"? JUL (Pronouced, "jewel") :slight_smile:
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=G7waq9mo5jixg2o6c) Outstanding, sir! Awesome that you made that point crystal clear. I would think nothing less to be the case. As I'm sure you have as well, I have seen so much gaslighting  happening in our country of late. One of the more over-arching problems we have, together with plain old apathy.
Looks like the military isn't what it once was.
https://notthebee.com/article/biden-signs-executive-order-granting-free-transgender-surgery-to-any-member-of-military-funded-by-taxpayers
Piss on Biden. That POS needs to just pack his bags and go to hell. The sooner the better.
Glad to have you. We reorganized in August last year and have been busy trying to be a model. We also have a vetting process to bring members into the group so to speak. It‚Äôs to ensure we keep radicals, racists, and those with bad intentions out. If you could email trustseeker69@protonmail.com you‚Äôll get further instructions
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=XLc3MEzniFebbbEzB) As expected, we are beginning to find out who our true allies are
It was good to hear from Stewart Rhodes last night.
Looking forward to his return this morning after the interview.
BIG THANKS to @jpj for getting the chat back up and moderating last night's meeting.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=HC8PimMHh7u5DSrLd) Well said
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=Zfy9iF23K7JrFiAEx) Amen
It was good to know where Stewart stands regarding the integrity of the 2020 election. Naturally we are not all of the same opinion. Some of us agree with Stewart, the election fraud rose to the level of election coup and portends the outcome of future elections. There are also OKers who disagree, believing  evidence of widespread fraud fell short of convincing, and look forward to winning 2024.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=A2KfVlJ93ioecVOC2) Ditto here
For those who missed the forum/chat meeting last night (scroll back in the chat), Stewart remains steadfast to OKer's mission, and laid out his takeaway from lessons learned by Colonists in the years leading up to Lexington---lessons that can be applied today. Though I too look to our Founders' wisdom and experience, my takeaway differs somewhat from Stewart's, respectfully.
Thanks for the heads up, @gre81.
@haphazard, I poured over HOURS of evidence in the weeks following the election. I don't need a SCOTUS to tell me what happened.

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=r2eaxdgzkd4bS62D2) Great question! It has to be something around "strength in numbers." I've been a lone wolf here for too long. Its tough getting this silent majority to come out of the woodwork to organize in my neck of the woods (Southern Colorado). But I remain hopeful...

I've that a lot from other patriots throughout the country over the past year. So much isolation and (well understood) hyper-guardedness. I will keep trying though, and pray our leadership consensus is correct, in that the enemy's overreach will soon collapse on them under its own weight, thus igniting the anger of the the American Eagle. In the meantime, I'm just thankful to be in the company of fellow patriot like you all.

Doesn't matter how many rounds are in the hands of people if they don't actually care enough to use them. If people aren't courageous enough to stand up against a damn MASK policy, what makes you think they'll stand up against threats of ARMED enforcement when these spineless jackasses are told to hand over their hardware...
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=zhPzdzzzMaBbg3LRK) Point taken! Still seems like a relevant strategy, in the situation we face today. Are we speaking of a war of attrition?

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=VJ34xIyvJoktCbQvS) For sure! I was watching it unfold on TV on Fox, and even I could tell it was staged, pure BS calling it an "insurrection." But I can definitely see how MSM played their part in successfully spinning it that way for the sheep, with all their smoke-and-mirror deception techniques on full display. I understand "strategic patience," but what amazes me is that there hasn't been a REAL insurrection yet. Now, with you guys, I see the beginnings of a viable strategy for unifying our ranks
I hope Stewart has ideas how he hopes to restructure chain of command this morning. As well as encouraging news how he hopes leadership will be more engaged.
Before the Founding Fathers were at work, the 13 colonies tried many times to work together. Each time, the efforts failed. Why should out people work to defend this other colony? It took time, working locally and watching the whole group of colonies and the failure, one after another to get the Crown to provide relief, to fondly get everyone more or less writing out watching
Sorry, my message is screwed up. Can't get this phone app to let me see the bottom of my message

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=dRrBxPJgm5soYssxn) Amen, sir! I have just been here a couple of days, but have already made friends for life. I love the atmosphere of mutual respect I've found here thus far, and it gives me some much-needed hope. I just want to take a minute to say, isn't it amazing to have the blessing of this platform of authentic American liberty and free speech to freely exchange our different views on, without fear of persecution? Its really true (for me at least, the takeaway lesson), that you really don't notice the well until its gone dry. We speak about nothing that ALL American citizens should be standing up for in her hour of need, and yet the enemy seeks to brand us as terrorists! THAT IN ITSELF, to me, is the very essence of tryanny. While we must always remind ourselves that we are first and foremost human beings--brothers and sisters in this fight of our lives--I am inspired by all the courage I see here, and the flame that ignited the men who first convened in those early days of our founding. Let's make the most of it.

@windy , you pulled the most relevant quote from last night. 
The historian in me takes issue with details and context Stewart, here, described. But his point is made clear: OKers by and large take a defensive posture. My view of colonial history and the various means our Founders employed to beat back tyranny is a bit broader. Our Founding Fathers employed both defensive and offensive tactics, as well as intel, organization, media, widespread boycotts, and others.
ANYONE IN NV PUSHING STATE TO VOID ALL THIS CRAP DEMS ARE PUSHING ON US?  HOW MANY STATES DO WE NEED TO NULLIFY ALL THE BILLS PASSED BY THIS CONGRESS?

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=jNAqhk5DTryjLvyp5) That is an awesome and unexpected development. Good news, indeed! If we still make it happen at a grassroots level, a massive civil disobedience/non-compliance movement would be the ideal short-term solution. Here in Colorado (the far-left loons/RINO coalition controlling the state government, we seem to have tactical advantage in the rural areas, such as where I live. Just no organization or leadership. Many of you are quite aware that we have what are called "Second Amendment Sanctuaries" which status I pray can be leveraged (through the County Sheriffs) into such a nullifcation movement here. I am only just beginning to explore how this may get started (if it hasn't already, as there is virtually total media suppression of the freedom movement in Colorado). I just discovered Sheriff Mack's website, and would really like to get our Southern Colorado Sheriff's on board asap. Interested to know if (many of you Sheriffs and other LE) have managed to leverage that strategy? I definitely don't feel comfortable approaching them alone, or until I have some guidance from others here in the group. Here's the referenced links:

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=T2gdH8sr9vLtPWTLH) Totally agree with you there. I'm certain they used far more in their arsenal than we will ever know. Most were spiritual warriors, as well, and among the wisest people who ever lived. But still flesh-and-blood men and women, as we are. We can and must live up to their standards in this fight. I understand OK being a defensive deterrent to tyranny in our Founding Fathers' spirit. I am learning much, and I agree that the most vital work is at our individual community level. I just pray our numbers will grow and that we will unify fast enough to adapt to the realities on the ground.
Ill wear a mask only when it comes with a firing squad!!!
You might be thinking of a blindfold. :laughing:
@WKNC Right on, ain't it the truth! And I'm with you on the mask deal. When people started wearing them, I knew we were in big trouble. If nothing else, we have to get rid of the masks now, as they are remain the most visible sign of submission to the tyranny.

On a rainy September 13, 1814, British warships sent a downpour of shells and rockets onto Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor, relentlessly pounding the American fort for 25 hours. The bombardment, known as the Battle of Baltimore, came only weeks after the British had attacked Washington, D.C., burning the Capitol, the Treasury and the President's house.
It seemed as though mother earth had opened and was vomiting shot and shell in a sheet of fire and brimstone," Key wrote later. But when darkness arrived, Key saw only red erupting in the night sky. Given the scale of the attack, he was certain the British would win. The hours passed slowly, but in the clearing smoke of "the dawn's early light" on September 14, he saw the American flag‚Äînot the British Union Jack‚Äîflying over the fort, announcing an American victory.

.it the whole reason im out there...dad we dont wanna fight em in our front yard..make it haooen somewhere else
I know right
‚ÄúEveryone wanna be a gangster till it‚Äôs time to do gangster shit.‚Äù In regards to people wanting others to fight for them. Seems to be pretty wide spread
We can say iwish this..i wish that...shit in one hand and wish in the other..see which one fills up first....till the dam breaks....all we can do is watch and be vigilant on our local level
Most people that have never had to do gangster shit tend to shy away from the rough deal....
Not advocating and or calling for violence here but violence itself seems to be a universal language. For some reason it seems to be the only thing that people understand no matter what. It‚Äôs kind of sad that it is that way. 
Very true. 
Most are unwilling to get their hands dirty but expect other to so they can reap the benefits. 
There used to be a time when we could disagree and still have a conversation. Those days are long gone. Mostly by choice of the other side and not so much us. 
That oath was instilled in me from birth. It‚Äôs always been there even if not spoken. I was raised to treat others with respect and stand up for those that can‚Äôt do it for themselves. That is what I am passing on to my children if nothing else. 
Non violent resistance is key. Make them look like the bad guys.
Democrats own every branch of government, media, military and tech.  Non-violent resistance will get you squat.
In here typing
Nobody‚Äôs calling for violence 009zz. I believe the comment was we are being targeted with violence and then being blamed for it. I agree with LT, we need to to paint them as the bad guys. 
Democrats are even pushing that pedophilia is ok.  I think looking bad isn't a worry for them.
The government is about to undergo serious monetary / fiscal stress that is going to cripple their agency long-term. The dollar is failing. Bitcoin is about to become a huge problem for government power when it overtakes the market cap of gold and becomes the new reserve currency of the world. They won't be able to print money anymore.

@branden-88 I see the same talk here as everywhere on the net.  Lots of complaining, no action, no target, no plan and no organization.  People here seem more concerned with PR than actually doing something.
Who shoots first matters. The public needs to believe they shot first.
deja vu in here all over again, and again...
@branden-88 I wouldn't focus so much on a spark, as it's not going to happen on it's own.  Sometimes you have to be the one to do it.  The public isn't going to rise up now to be honest.  Things are going to have to get way way worse before that happens.
I'm not necessarily saying go alone.  I'm just giving feedback on what I see.
Media will brand you a terrorist doing nothing right now
They already are
@paulieb81 I agree on needing leadership and a plan.  Thus far I don't see any, it seems PR and interviews are more important.
I understand, however a good leader is not taking the time to see who is behind him
Has anyone heard from the hot head that was here before the deplatform, decided to "make shit happen" on the 6th that was up to his standards, wasn't satisfied with the pace of things or the suggestions we were receiving and then went it alone?
ahhh, some of you were here
88 wasn't
point is... no one has heard from him since
relaxing improves your aim, as well as your nerves
50 bucks bought you the opportunity to get vetted
they're woefully behind
Is there a command structure here?
suck it up and get your shit together in your own backyard
Do we have former Colonels or Generals directing this outfit?
I've chewed on Stewart's ear... let's see if he listens. The talk going on now is that same as it was before the deplat
I encouraged him to show up regularly and/or appoint someone(s) publically that would tend to the flock
copy that
to edit your message, click on it then the three dots
As for leading, I was contemplating trying to start something with Commifornia before we went off the air
before the deplat, we had people joining left and right. upper management couldn't keep up, especially under the pressure of "deadlines" for lack of a better word. but then, same as now, to thing to do was organize locally as best you can in the vacuum and be patient
the fact is, there are two organizations: the inner circle which are all vetted and communicate on a separate platforms, and then there is the rest of us
everyone chatting here is the rest of us

What's app is I think Bill Gates
WhatsApp isn't nearly as secure as Telegram, and is owned by Facebook.  At least on Telegram you have the option of switching to end to end encryption in a private chat.  Signal is best for that, though
Telegram is Russian owned but works well. Subject to a lot of uninvited guests and spam. But no risk of going off the air
I thought it was this young russian dude
I'm gonna scroll up and see what you guys are talking about. Did Stewart ever come back to the chat after this morning?
Telegram was launched in 2013 by brothers Nikolai and Pavel Durov. Previously, the pair founded the Russian social network VK, which they left in 2014 after it was taken over by President Putin's allies. Pavel Durov sold his remaining stake in VK and left Russia after resisting government pressure.[23][24] Nikolai Durov created the MTProto protocol that is the basis for the messenger, while Pavel Durov provided financial support and infrastructure through his Digital Fortress fund, with partner Axel Neff joining as a second co-founder. The company and the app were started in Russia in 2013 and later moved to Germany.[25][26] Telegram Messenger states that its end goal is not to bring profit,[27][28] but it is not currently structured as a non-profit organization.
I've known a few UAE guys, but never named Nikolai
In any case, Telegram is very user friendly. It's where I keep track of the major players in the election litigation and other things of interest.
Always trust your gut
I would much rather be wrong because I trusted my gut, than dead because I didn't.

Don't get discouraged by the lack of chatting in the state chats... it took a long time before the deplat and it took long enough to get back up that I'd assume many said to themselves "fuck that shit"

If you don't have a battery-operated AM/FM radio, that's on your grocery list. Suggest you get one of those survival ones with crank power and attached solar panel.

You got your 2-way radio, AM/FM radio, flashlight, candles, and lighters (buy extra lighters for your neighbors).

Buy an old-fashioned paper road map of your state and a map of the US. You remember . . . the kind you can never refold like new. Yeah, you need both of those maps in hard copy.
Your not going to find leadership here your going to here the same thing that is always said, build yourself up locally
NEW GUYS...
Did you hear back from your state leader yet? Keep trying.
Go out and buy two gallons of bottled water for each family member and store it in a cool dark place easy to get to. Also buy a couple 24-packs of small water bottles (your neighbors will thank you).

For those keeping tabs, it looks like the GA "show me the ballots" (Fulton County) are once again in play along with what's going on with the pending audits in AZ and NH
I got a name... Bill
although some people call me asshole
Sleep well....
all good
With all the powers that be in Carson being communist we have to take our state back county by county.  Every county sheriff needs to be on board to reject these unconstitutional laws.  They need to be encouraged to join the Constitutional sheriff and peace officers org. ran by sheriff Richard Mack.  He has on line classes on the constitution and how to approach your county sheriff.  They will be our last defense .  
Thanks jonrob for the instructions, joined US, NC, Cabarrus, and Mecklenburg!
Interesting discussions today. Got lots of what I need spread out at numerous locations. Two questions:
Announcements From Oath Keepers Senior Staff
Does everyone really go to bed this early? And, I need a new bug out vehicle; 200 mile range needed, and I have solar at the endpoints. I know, fag Californian, eco solar energy, but I don‚Äôt need infrastructure to travel between family members. I‚Äôm not going to live long enough to worry about needing new batteries. Also, got lots of stored gasoline, but not an ounce of diesel.
Welcome Carter!

Checking in Charlotte area right on the NC/SC line about 5 minutes drive
I‚Äôm not sure on the OK Rocket Chat. On the My Patriot Network both counties have their own Group page listed by the name of their county. 
Welcome DE7, the SC thread is mighty thin.....I still hope some coastal carolina folks reach out.
The best way to connect with other Oath Keepers is through this forum, but if you want to connect with other like-minded Patriots to build up a local group, MY PATRIOT NETWORK is a powerful tool you can use. MPN is a forum that connects people on the Global, United States, State, and County levels. I'm the Administrator/Organizer of MPN for North Carolina. My goal is to establish a strong coalition of citizens on the LOCAL LEVEL, assisting or establishing Community Watches, which is one of the strongest initiatives that Oath Keepers has promoted. MPN and OK are aligned completely on this. MPN is a bit hard to figure out at first because of its structure, so I'm going to include here a list of procedures to follow once you join MPN.

https://mypatriotsnetwork.com/

MY PATRIOT NETWORK (MPN) is a bit confusing until you realize that it is set up as a hierarchy: a main group divided into sub-groups, with each sub-group further divided into sub-groups.

First step upon joining MPN is to select the main group ‚ÄúGLOBAL PATRIOTS UNITE.‚Äù Once you click on the JOIN GROUP button, it will change to a YOU‚ÄôRE A PATRIOT button. DO NOT click on that button again unless you want to un-join that group. 

The GLOBAL PATRIOTS UNITE group is important because there are people in other countries that support our fight to maintain our Constitutional Republic. They know that if we fall, they will fall soon thereafter. This allows members to access their communications and their unique perspectives. Our experiences may be of use to them as well.

When on the GLOBAL PATRIOTS UNITE page, scroll down to just below the group description and you will see a horizontal bar of menu selections. Select the SUBGROUPS. Go down the page until you see the subgroups listed at the bottom.    You will need to click on the box ‚ÄúAll types‚Äù and within the drop down select ‚ÄúMPNS‚Äù in order to find the UNITED STATES subgroup and select that. Join.

Repeat the same process as above. Go down, select SUBGROUPS then click on the box ‚ÄúAll types‚Äù and within the drop down select ‚ÄúMPNS‚Äù in order to find and select (insert your state name here). Join. 

Repeat the same process. Go down, select SUBGROUPS, then select MPNS, then select your county. Join. If you do not see your county listed, post on (your State) forum that you are from a county that does not have a County Group page and (your State) Organizer/Moderator will make you one. If you do not have a state Organizer/Moderator, somebody will have to volunteer and send in the form shown on the state page to become one.

If you want to be active in your county to gather Patriots together to your county group and to keep conversations on track, click on the MODERATOR APPLICATION link provided in the description text in your county group. It may take a few weeks before you get a reply.

In the mean time, at the bare minimum, please monitor your STATE forum for timely information. Every now and then you will see that there is very interesting information about events in a another county. The primary focus should be your STATE so that this MPN tool will help us become effective at making a positive change in our state. The greatest and most effective long reaching change always starts at the LOCAL LEVEL. If we can‚Äôt accomplish that, we can‚Äôt add to the success of other counties and states  to make a real and lasting change in our country.

I suggest you copy and paste this into a NOTES app in case this post disappears or gets buried in conversation.

Has anyone used that patriot group listed above
A great tool for your yard and this will sound a bit out there but works excellent is to put a bird feeder on each corner
They are great at detecting when something is off and they make plenty of noise to let you know.

I'm new to the group and not real tech savvy.  I'm in Grand Rapids, MI and want to hook up with whatever local group there might be.  How?
I'm new to Oath Keepers and would like to contact someone in Grand Rapids.

Great article!
Pass it on to liked minded folks you know.  We have to build a true grass roots effort and get the "disorganized majority" on the same page.
We have a member(TRAXX) that did not get the second email with the login button and he cannot get on the forum. Can you take a look? Really appreciate it.
Need his email address.
The one registered with OK
He works early so I will have to find out later.
He responded  Matteblack69@gmail.com
Ok let me see
He is not in the system.  That means that either he is not in our national membership database or he is there under a different email address.  He should try to log in on the national website and see if that works.
When I do a search I find him  traxx  He got the first email saying welcome but not the second with the login button
Hes a postal worker so lets get him set up. You know how they can be
Give me a moment
He should get an email shortly
Thank you very much

@jpj What's the sit rep with state leadership? Is it too high-level to communicate here?
I can say everyone is very busy with all that is going on, so it is not surprising they have not made it into here yet.
@jpj, what is "all that is going on"? Can you elaborate?
kentucky-patriot it is important to contact Mitch as well.  Even RINOS and DEMS need to know how the people in their districts and states feel.  If they are on the fence on an issue and they start getting heavy blow back from their home it could push them our way.
Sure.  Turn on your favorite source of leftist news.
It is all there/
So boys and girls if Senior leadership is busy I hope you understand.
I am not Senior Leadership.  I just run errands.
Thats correct
I'd like coffee, please.
Very busy im sure
And we just heard from the most senior of all!
He he he..your funny
Keeping.AZ you need to read left wing news.  It is a poor operator who does not know the field intel.
I check lefty news daily
Just like I used to listen to Radio Moscow during the cold war.
It was great hearing from Stewart. No doubt he's got his hands full. I'm inquiring about STATE leadership.
I know..im

Get to contacting your congress critters to just say no.
"Choose your ground" (above) is a great article and really our only option. Political activism has been largely ignored by lay conservatives. Time to step up and get in the game. Take training where offered on how to be effective in that arena. Its not my cup of tea but if we want to save this country we need to put in the effort that the left has been doing for decades. Most of our politicians are just in it for the money and power.

Hello Eddie, welcome
welcome glfrederick
welcome ghutch
Hello from Communist-occupied Colorado. I continue to try to recruit, but no signs of organized resistance to the tyranny here.  Prospects for freedom looking dim, but hoping for guidance soon, before I have to jump ship for Texas or Florida
One place to start is the leadership institute. https://www.leadershipinstitute.org/  Lots of workplace training but also grassroots activism et.. Look through the classes, lots of them are free, lots are online. Another is https://www.nrailafrontlines.com/?utm_campaign=online_workshop_emai_202103_39&utm_medium=email&utm_source=frontlines. this is a gun rights group that offers training on gun rights activism. Each states republican party should have activist training available. check their websites.
@jpj, THANKS for being here on our chat, as a go-between. Really helps morale! Thanks!
I'll move from Colorado to Arizona if there are any serious militias forming there who will connect with me. Nothing happening here in Colorado, and I want to be where I can make a difference
Another effort underway is the https://theprecinctproject.wordpress.com/  According to this guy who is endorsed by Steve Bannon, Thier are 400,000 republican precinct committee officer positions in the country but only 200,000 filled. The gist is that if we can fill the remaining 200,000 positions with conservatives we can run the rinos out.

AZ Patriots came out in force Wed night....est 3,000 for Mike Lindell, Goser etc.   I;m in Cochise Co and had to work but would have loved to be there.  Thanks JPJ for the cred update.
Add pontoons and a propeller.
jpj is Mike "Keeping.AZ'?
Mike is a good man.  I know him from his time in NYC.  Not military, but has a good head on his shoulders.  Used to be a chef in NYC.  Now gun dealer in AZ.
papaprim.....he is tech challenged.
Hi papaprim  glad to see you made it
Thanks for the  info.  I knew  we had someone by that name in PHX but never met him.  I'm glad we have him there and in AZ!

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=mkbTm9Z6wsZM4Go4S) I don't think we've met but Stewart has mentioned you.  Nice to meet you.  Let's get the AZ chat full & rocking!
Hi there.
Great job with this site JPJ!
well they got me then I paid 50.00 and never got a kit but that was two years ago lol
Woefully behind? That is an understatement. Is there even a process? This reminds me of union tactics when you ask about anything discussed with the company they say,"we're working on it"! It means, they are in bed with the company and the peons that believe in "the process" that they are working on your behalf is a lie!
There is NO vetting process, else it would be done fast. A simple background check, even at the expense of the "to be vetted" member, would be a process. This is disorganization at its finest!
some guys buy a second starter for the vehicle they have and keep it in a EMP proof pouch so they can swap it out should that happen
@Bravo-Golf what state are you in?
Previously, as it appeared to me, the vetting process began in conjunction with a call to arms (the few that I saw in my time here) where someone would would solicit "requests" to be vetted. I never submitted a request so I know nothing of the process (speed, thoroughness, etc) other than some people who apparently got vetted would "disappear", apparently moving to another, secure forum apart from the one here. I've yet to see mention of vetting from those who would do the vetting in the last 2 days, on this new platform.
this is concerning
They are denying bond for all Oath Keepers or suspected Oath Keepers.  They did catch and release or low figure bail on all the rioters in Dem cities.  In NYC the DA refused to prosecute most and the Attorney General has started a lawsuit against the NYPD over excessive force against rioters.
Email sent.
We have to start demanding the release of the political prisoners.  As much as I hate the UN I think it would be nice irony to lodge a complaint with the UN.
People watched so many good people be attacked at the December speech and decided to make sure it didnt happen in January, now they try to blame the good for what the bad orchestrated. Its ridiculous.
Same story, no paywall: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-100-charged-capitol-attack-investigation/story?id=76413025
16722 possible defendants on  here then huh...we must be very careful about verbage....
@bravo-echo there is no paywall on Epoch Times.  You can sign up for a free account and read the news.  Not sure if the free account limits articles per day as I find ET a worthy news org and have chosen to give them their $7/month.
Thats stories tearing me up guys.....im almost in tears....we would lose eveything if i was taken off...young wife..young kids.....scary
That's how the patriots felt in 1776
Write your congress critters and demand an end to POLITICAL Persecution.
Remember before a single shot was fired there was lots of mail between the 13 colonies and parliment.  Took months to go back and forth.  Now we have instant email.  Start using it.  It may not help, but it can not hurt.
https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/03/shock-report-fbi-sends-military-vehicle-turret-2-vans-6-fbi-vehicles-3-local-police-vehicles-arrest-young-father-attended-jan-6-rally-unbelievable-interview/

Expect more of this since we're all terrorists now in the eyes of Democrats
its really almost unbelievable that our police and citys have been forced to there knees for months to years and this is when the start lining everyone up
They want us to be afraid because of the persecution  of these men.....it does concern me...but it more over infuriates me....brothers and sisters, we have to stay the course....my descendants deserve to grow up like i did...
@skydivinglawman Not sure about where you are, but in Chicago the police can't wait to break the skulls of conservatives.  Not to mention Portland as well.
This sucks
"Here is the judges reasons for denying bail: While Joshua doesn‚Äôt have a criminal background and has strong ties to the community and is not believed to be a flight risk and may not have been violent that day, he continued to have communication with members of Oath Keeps after the 6th which ‚Äúproves‚Äù he has no remorse for the events of that day."

So here's the kicker; they demand blood and total allegiance to the party.  No remorse, no freedom.
The A-team, knight rider, GI Joe, Air wolf would never allow this
Thats even more ridiculous
They are coming for us.  Stay calm, but prepare.
They're transferring him to DC as well, why?  Why do they have to ship him to the militarized zone instead of waiting for trial in his home state.  I expect he'll disappear in a hole now that he's a domestic terrorist.
This really makes all our years of service feel empty
but I am sure they can spin that statement now
@1984isNow the constitution says he has to go to DC
For attending a rally?
Case must be done in the district in which the alleged event happened
Plenty of people have been able to stay in their home state to prepare before trial in another.
Many more have been shipped.  Usually shipping off happens right after bail hearing.
Sorry, but I don't buy it.
Thanks for the info @papaprim
I cant think of the term but a request to be heard in your home court can be made, I am guessing its because its fedral
Good comment made in the article:
30 FBI swat agents to take down a 70-year old Roger Stone
35 FBI agents to take down a medical doctor who used a bullhorn on January 6th
15 FBI agents to investigate a garage pull
200+ FBI agents to protect Heir Whitmer

0 to investigate Antifa and BLM burning down your children's schools.
Two agents assigned to spy on Trump during his term
Been dealing with crap on federal criminal cases for a local friend for years.  Have to be tired where incident happened.  And once bail is denied pretty much the rest happens where the incident took place.
Have a friend that is a Federal Defender with an office in a National Park, because if a crime happens in the park it has to be tried there.
The FBI admitted they have no evidence and arrested him anyway and shipped him to a fortified military zone where legal representation and family can't get to him; with a liberal judges' rubber stamp.  Nothing about this is normal and that dude is going to disappear for quite sometime.
Civil cases can be requested to be heard in home state.  Criminal cases must be heard where the crime took place
And on civil cases that is in the home state of the defendant.  Plaintiff does not have that option.
To me, the only thing worse than providing personal information in return for something easily available elsewhere is receiving spam to remind me that I willingly gave out personal information for something easily available elsewhere and the only thing worse that that is paying for that privilege.
@bravo-echo You do not want news alerts from ET, fine.  There others that might.
NY is quiet at the moment.  I will be having face to face one on one meets with NY members shortly, but I have to get the trashed national tech infrastructure back together before I do much else.
Will post that answer in general
I have been asked about fundraisers for the political prisoners.  There are logistic issues.  The "standard" places will transfer MILLIONS for the Kamala Harris spring violent criminals multiple times fund, but they refuse to allow their use to gather funds for mostly or completely peaceful protesters who are for the constitution.  As a result getting things set  up has been tough.  Molly Pitcher on here is working on getting a fund set up, and some of the accused have managed to get things set up for themselves.  Once we have things in place with respect to the info of where donations can be sent it will be posted on the main web site.  Additionally there may be a call up to protect families.  Many families are getting death threats.
We also have an FFL willing to donate a fine firearm for a raffle to benefit our brothers and sisters. @papaprim has made that offer.  I know him personally he is a good man.  If you need arms or ammo talk to him.  Better to keep our $$ in our own community if we can!
Did that answer it for you?

How would I know you get spammed, you ask? People are also entitled to know what to expect by signing up, a reasonable detail to consider before committing.
How much you want to bet that list was copy/pasted direct from Commifornia statutes?
Nope, these are stricter it seems
I would but I went last week....had a horrible accident.  Still too raw to talk about   LOL
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been 17 years since the original Assault Weapons Ban expired, and the plague of gun violence continues to grow in this country. To be clear, this bill saves lives. When it was in place from 1994-2004, gun massacres declined by 37 percent compared with the decade before. After the ban expired, the number of massacres rose by 183 percent,‚Äù Feinstein said in a statement Thursday.

Well funny story there, less than 1% of those gun violence incidents were rifles, let alone the "Assault Weapons" you are trying to ban
But, "Black rifle scary" so, you know. Its apparent, as the Mini-14 without folding stock is exempted
But notice the last paragraph of the bill: 

SEC. 7. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and the application of such provision or amendment to any person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.

Sooo, if any part of our unconstitutional, then the rest of it is fine, and you will have to get every part declared unconstitutional.
guess I don't follow proposed legislation as closely as I should. Was news to me.

So you are saying there is no vetting process. Great, then the "secure" forum is not so secure. And we know that it is not secure, however, the point of them sending an email was to minimize security issues. I was excited to join in Jan. 2020 but no longer. Valuable leadership is lacking here, almost, flying by the seat of your pants. I joined another group and paid for my own vetting in 2 days. At least there is a process from among leadership to attempt to screen membership. I have ssen more done in about 2-3 weeks in that group than in 14 months at OK. Moreover, the OK lead from my state left a secure vetting group without saying a word and afyer several of us forwarded documentation for vetting. That was 6 or more weeks after we submitted our docs! What a crock. Needless to say, I left the group as soon as he did!
great post 1patriot
Let's do more than piss and moan about this!
other than dc on jan 6 - i do not see much happening while we are being mowed down
No, I'm saying that there is some vetting process that I've never bothered to subject myself to but know must exist because I've seen others take a stab at it. As for a secure forum, are you referring to this one?  Common sense dictates that this forum can never be more secure than the previous forum simply because there is no vetting (that I'm aware) prior to being granted entry. As for administration of the org, all I can add to your observation is that it is what it is and any disappointment you'd have with that would be on par with your expectations.

"They are in the process of goading OK to make a move...." -- @ordinaryjoe 

I think yours is a well considered point. I tend to think, however, the federal govt hopes to avoid direct confrontation with OK and patriot groups, particularly at this time as the Left consolidates power in DC.  The Left hasn't weeded out all the hardcore patriots from the armed services yet. More likely the feds are hoping, in making examples of a few OKers, the rest of us will stand down.
San Gabriel Mountains checking in here.
Good evening
Exactly keeping.az....i concur
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=Ci2qJTaF59B2FoFkN) Good evening :slight_smile:
The counter-narrative: https://www.rawstory.com/antifa-capitol-insurrection/
This is what I think too.
Someone a little closer to home!  i was beginning to think I was the only one in SoCal...
At least in the L.A./IE area
They still have a web presence
Yes I did. 
Ok gotcha i tried looking for both in here and didn‚Äôt find anything
Thanks been in OK since 2013 looking to get more active considering what‚Äôs at stake
‚ÄúAllowed‚Äù how generous I can keep my own property I paid for....
Im brand new to OK DE7, everything is at stake.  I hope more SC/NC OK's come forward, one way to activate some groups
Quiet tonight. Friday.
Keeping, what part of AZ are you in?
Hi, FN9! Scottsdale.
1patriot   What area of AZ are you in?
I'm in Cochise County....red county!
I camped Huachucha. Been to Bisbee, Tombstone.
I love this area...rural with lots of patriots.  I'm between Ft Huachuca & Tombstone
Hey Branden...
Bisbee has a cool vibe.
The hits just keep coming from the Dems/Left
Bisbee is the small patch of liberal in Cochise Co...lOL
Well,  people have said grabbing our guns was the line in the sand, we'll see how that plays out
Not surprised. I was there with a friend for an annual poetry contest.
Tombstone is my fav down here...the 2nd Amendment City per city proclamation
Branden, where are you from?
If they don't cancel the filibuster and some Dem Sen get heat, it may not fly this time but they will keep trying
Is Wyoming Con Carry?
Same here in AZ  Con Carry
Left libs suck great big moose peckers!
I think that is the reason they keep the NG in DC.......people have made it clear how strong they feel about 2A and the DC jackals think DC will really be stormed when they grab guns
LOL bravo...they do indeed
now that's rural!  I have to drive 18 mi for the nearest Walmart
If I may ask, how long have you guys been members of OK
I'm so close, I could hit Walmart with a moose turd.
I've been a member almost from the beginning.  I was So AZ Reg Dir for about 5 years
LOL KAz
I used to live in Tempe but it reminded me too much of CA so I escaped south
@FN9, who's our AZ state Leader? Do we have one right now?
Very rural western north  carolina mountains here..very pro gun.....signs in the local stores say welcome to wear your guns here. And signs that say...no masks allowed  too!!!
Keeping  We do but there is alot of disconnect here
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=BarH2zfdEWgCLKebh) When I moved to Gilbert I was surrounded by wheat fields and you could smell the pig farm when the wind was right
@branden-88, are you near the Salmon River?
Injad abusiness call the local sheriff on me back when this shit first started...he came..told me not to worry about it...said fuck this place
Papaprim is up in your area.  At least close.  He's in Mesa.  We have a group down here in Green Valley that meets monthly.  The largest group is up in Yavapai Co
I like that WKNC
Very much so.yes
I IM'd papa. Waiting to hear.
He posted some info in the AZ room
Saw that. Why does your user name say "Leader"?
...jpj handing out stripes???
Because I still am involved in the role on certain things
Stewart assigned it
Army Intel unit down in Huachuca, no?
II remained involved after I stepped down as Reg Dir
It is, Keeping...  Interesting activity at times
My Biden money just got deposited!
That Biden $$ just cost you $17,000 in national debt
your share
meh... they'll go bankrupt here, inflation will eat it to ZERO and none of it will even matter
Biden Bucks are already coming? He just signed that bill yesterday!
that's true bravo.  Time to use extra cash for needed/anticipated purchases while it still has some buying power.
I'm surprised they aren't holding those Biden Bucks until AFTER the Assault Weapons ban passes. :laughing:
just be thankful it's not taxed... of course that's also an illusion since they let Trumps tax cuts expire
If enough people refused to pay taxes, they couldn't get everyone.  Civil Disobedience.
@bravo-echo, are you still held up in CA?
As long as Mom is with me, yes
That was my next question.
...delicately worded.
she got her two shots and seems to still be plugging away, so that's good
I fled CA almost 11 yrs ago & never looked back
FN, what part of CA?
me on the other hand... they can go shove them shots up their asses... so I been working on my will lol
I was in Huntington Beach...by the beach
I had a friend lived north of the Bay.
That was a good place... in the 70s
I have to say,, I was proud of my hometown when they came out against masks and when they ran ANTIFA off
@bravo-echo, I think COVID is the least of our worries. So keep working on that will! :laughing:
Oh I aint worried about that... was experiencing other things lately... and decided 15 years is way too long to get the ex disinherited
Looks like CA is going to boot Newsom
Keeping  Did you make it to that rally in Mesa on Wed night?
I better give a shout out to the new guys...

If you're new to the chat, WELCOME! @bravo-echo has your Welcome package.
FN, I didn't know about the rally. Was Mike Lindell here?
Yep and assorted other patriot speakers....Rep Paul Gosar etc
Shoot. Probably handed out free pillows. Missed that one.
I had to work and it was too far when I got off work. or I would have been there
Love his pillows

The Roosevelt Reservation is the 60-foot (18 m)-wide strip of land owned by the United States Federal Government along the United States side of the United States‚ÄìMexico Border in three of the four border states. Federal and tribal lands make up 632 miles (1,017 km), or approximately 33 percent, of the nearly 2,000 miles (3,200 km) total. Private and state-owned lands constitute the remaining 67 percent of the border, most of which is located in Texas.[1]

Bans magazines and other ammunition feeding devices that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition, which allow shooters to quickly fire many rounds without needing to reload. Owners may keep existing magazines.
Requires a background check on any future sale, trade or gifting of an assault weapon covered by the bill.
Requires that grandfathered assault weapons are stored using a secure gun storage or safety device like a trigger lock.

We have to step up on helping this man and his family.  The government has frozen his accounts which means his retirement pay can not be accessed and in addition his wife was fired from her job because of the allegations against him.

Wow! Great article!
He‚Äôs right about one thing, no military coup but only because of the current state of the military Officer and SNCO/PO corps and soon the rank and file I am afraid. I don‚Äôt think even if it got so bad that they would do anything sad to say....

Checking in from outside Carthage TN. 
Not that I have seen. They are saying we are still waiting for them to join so maybe give it a week. 
Good Morning from Reno, NV. Patriots!
Morning WKNC, greywolf
@kentucky-patriot We will look into it.  The above about Harrelson was passed on to me by another member who I trusted to know what was going on.  I will not have a chance to do any research until tonight.
Not getting an answer in #NV. What is the Chain of Command for OK National/Regional/State/Local? Seems to me, we need to have a structure that is tangible! Leadership in National, Regional, State, and Local. I see NO Mission Statements, NO S.O.P's, NO R. O. C's, NO Schedules, No Command.   We are here for a reason! We have the experience! We have fought and bled for this country! ... ... ... We know that the Constitution is under massive attack, and could NOT be in a larger amount of crisis than it is right now! We "HOPE" that the Military acknowledges this and is doing something about it. They should know that ALL branches of Government have been compromised by both Foreign and Domestic actions. Knowing that the [legal] system is also compromised, there MUST be action taken by them. To instate the REAL winner of the November 2020 election (by seeing the evidence of the "Pre-Adjusted" vote tallies) and then, while taking orders [covertly] from that individual (after putting their support behind him for being the Constitutionally Elected one), to remove the corrupted organizations. But what if THEY are not doing this? Then WE will be the LAST defense to defend OUR Constitution and OUR Country! WE should be organizing none-the-less, for the possibility that WE, may one day, be called upon to once again defend her!
mornin' y'all - feelin more and more like 1776 is closing in
Good Morning DaveyE7!
Yes, 1patriot. I think it is.
Yes agreed feels like it each and every day
Maybe WE need to start our "Local Chapters".
I just want to say good morning and good day to all the FBI, ATF and any other 3 lettered communist organizations and their compromised agents monitoring this forum.  With that being said history DOES repeat itself which means organizing will again be done in local taverns and churches.
FYI, the other day I got a letter form the Canadian county sheriff‚Äôs office regarding the citizens posse he had formed. He has dismantled due to the influx of records requests of members of the posse 
FYI, the other day I got a letter from my county sheriff‚Äôs office regarding the citizen's posse he had formed. He has dismantled due to the influx of records requests of members of the posse. He doesn't want to give out our address so he officially dismantled it, but the tards don't know we are in contact with each other 
In order to Walk, you must first learn to Crawl and then take a risk. In order to Run, you must first learn to walk, and then take even MORE risks! I am sure we have our fair share of spies. But if all this board is for, is to spell out grievances, then WE are doing NOTHING more than having a bitch session. Time to build the "Local Chapters". To meet in person, and create the movement.
Did someone say beer?
I think so I am at Texhoma this weekend 
Local chapters would be a good start and then we could find out what each other not only look like but of course what capabilities we would have as a group. It will come to some point where action is a must, especially that the present occupiers will not go quietly
I am going to start in my area. I do NOT wish to be a commander, but will be willing to start until someone better than I shows up.
Roger that 009zz!
Are there any Ham Radio operators on here? OK NV "Kilo Mike Six Delta Zulu".
I have been a member of OK since 2013 and have watched and wondered about what we as an organization would do. I kept to myself watching and listening but seems like nothing. I watched our NC leader at the time leave completely. When we had the shootings at the recruiting offices I went in introduced myself and kept watch as best I could alone. Always felt alone even though I knew that not to be true, but it‚Äôs hard to keep the faith that way. Hence organizing would help everyone‚Äôs faith and resolve
Isn't it interesting that "Taverns and Churches" are what [they] want to keep closed in the Pandemic? Almost like [they] don't want Patriots organizing.
No I kept quiet and saw a lot of what was going on and kept my finger on the pulse so to speak. I wish I could have volunteered more for our national or local missions but life is what it is. Now I am at the point, it‚Äôs time if not now when?
Very true greywolf
I have encrypted comms at Telegram "Grey_Wolf_Ron" if anyone has ideas about local chapter setup.
009 are you on the NC thread yet?
I have spent over 30+ years in comms. A retired executive and comms engineer from a Silicon Valley company that created means for global comms for civilians and companies.
Comms are key... What do you do when the Internet and Cell phones go down?
Yes that‚Äôs it. What area of NC are you?
That‚Äôs a great point!  I never even thought of that.
I've been using Signal which has a secure setting.
The problem I have with Signal, it is run by the C_A. They hold the keys, quite literally.
Very good question greywolf. We would have to adapt, definitely would be a lag until something is established. Again getting organized at the local level will help
Gotcha. I travel around NC/SC a lot so have been up that way a lot. Always feels very leftist as soon as I get up that way lol
At this moment, there is only 1 way to establish comms in that event. HF Radio! I have outlined a lot of this on my website. Radios, How to Build Antennas, Satellite Phones and more. Without a Comms structure, we will be cut off completely. Time to get radios, and know where to meet! We also need redundancy. When this site was de-platformed in January, it proved the need! My website is "PatriotRoster.com" in case you are interested.
I will check that out and yes it did prove that when we went down comms were very much disrupted. Again to my point earlier this contributes to the isolation feelings we all get which is what they want. As a graduate of SERE school that is definitely a tactic they would use
I have some hand helds for comms with the family at close range but always knew that was not enough
My dad is in Winston and I am concerned about that. Probably have passed each other on 40!
My handheld..said range 80 miles....im in the mountains and can listen to the whole county..sheriff..emt...fire....super impressed
Quite right, both of you. VHF and UHF is good for keeping comms in a close knit area, or repeaters. But HF radio is needed to get out around the country/world. 009zz is correct. I am writing S.O.P's for the use of HF radios and Antennas. There is NO WAY you can just sit down to a radio and use it, without practice.
WKNC, you are picking up "Repeaters", not the actual radios of the first responders. Repeaters on high on the mountain tops and towers, to give them range.
Im sure...looked pretty complicated..this one used an app downloaded from internet to program it
Great! I will check out your site and may hit you up for advice. This is why we do this!
Yea..just learning about it...cool stuff
Sounds like a Beofang radio.
It was similair to baofang..thought  i would get it first before dropping for a good one
Im pretty much addicted to my "scanner" now
Used survival radios in the military but they were very simple to use because even though training was on a regular basis, in a survival situation you needed it almost idiot proof for the aircrew members!
Yep, I plan on discussing the terminology in the S.O.P. / USB, LSB, AM, FM, CW and so on. I have already created the S.O.P. for Antennas here: https://www.patriotroster.com/antennas/
Im pretty rural here..visited Raleigh and used it..had to cut it off...
Thanks greywolf..I've been reading up on that ay way
This is what I see for the starting of local chapters. Having Comms.
There are a few ofdinaryjoe. Use Duck-Duck-Go to look for the sites that have the tests. You will need to find a local Ham Group that has "VEC' testing, to take the test. You will want to get to at LEAST a General Class Licence.
But let's face facts..... WTSHTF, all bets are off! Knowing how to operate an HF radio, building an antenna and having access to one. DOES NOT REQUIRE A LICENSE! When in "Normal Times" you need a license to operate.
Find your local ham group. Call them... They will set you up. Telegram me at "Grey_Wolf_Ron" and I will get your information and look for a local group.
Some of the "GOOD" sites that charge a nominal fee. In the end, YOU need to stick with it. Keep taking the practice tests. Because of COVID, testing is mostly on line at the moment.
Alright all be back later gotta go piss of the locals and not wear my mask in a store lol. Be safe all!
Practice the test many times. They give you ALL the answers. I taught Morse Code for 5 years at the Navy Postgraduate School.
I do not consider Telegram "Social Media". I look at it as Encrypted Comms...
You do NOT need a license to use the GMRS or FMRS frequencies. I have over 20 radios I have handed out to friends and neighbors, to be able to have comms with me WTSHTF.
A few miles at around 5 watts. A 1/2 mile on 1 watt. Those are UHF frequencies. They are "Line-of-site" comms. Obstructions like trees and buildings, greatly effect their distance.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=moSM8LPXGbgLRr5ki) want more info
That will work. I bought a couple of 10 packs of the 888's and programed them up. for $10 each, you can't lose.
I may have to order up some more, to hand out at local chapter meets if I am to be the startup commander here.
1patriot, I will be writing and posting S.O.P.'s on my PatriotRoster website.
Like DaveyE7, I need to get to work, get under the hood of my Semi and change out the injector cups. Damn, I am getting to old for this shit. Well, at least I have the transportation covered. üòÅ
Man, this group seems dead.
As did I
Anyone in Dodge/Douglas counties? I'm up in Dodge.
I read a lot how people talk about options for coms being down. What about setting up a series of MESH networks, like what Greece had?
Other thoughts: We already know "cops" removed barriers, and posed for selfies with protestors. We know that the Capitol always has security, and when both houses were in session, security was absent...PBS even commented on that. We know that there is no pandemic nor "emergency." We also know that even when illegal EOs expire, they just issue new ones, without legislature approval, or the majority is as corrupt, and lets it go. It doesn't help that governors just wait for their legislators to be out of session, and then dictate tyranny when they're gone. We know judges are corrupt, and allow it to continue. At pretty much every level of government, they have failed us. Even in states that don't have mask mandates, county/city tyrants enact them, and governors do nothing; unlike in states where counties/cities don't try to force masks mandates, the governors go after them. The weaponize their agencies, to fine businesses hundreds and even thousands of dollars, making the businesses push for mask tyranny, so that they aren't punished.

What. Is. Being. Done?
@captbob - Yep.  Always down to meet up with like minded folks for a drink

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=4KLvyQxDqtt2HZbB7) Hey when you crawl out from under the hood I would love your advice on what kind of radio would be good to start off with
Back on all
what just happened?  lost access to your site and my email too
What happened 1patriot?
been sending my post of yesterday re grandfather via email to other contacts.  today when i try to send it, my email access shuts down.  when i switched to ok chat, the page appeared partially blocked - the went blank entirely
Do we know who we can ask about such things since this is all new for all of us?
I know using this on my phone it has been trial and error trying to figure stuff out or get caught up on this thread it will jump unexpectedly but I work around it
That‚Äôs who I thought maybe dm him 1patriot? If it‚Äôs working for you?
Wondering if anyone was using the Rocket Chat app on your cell phone to access this chat? Didn‚Äôt want to try it unless someone recommends
not using cell phone to access ok site; using laptop.  source of web access via hotspot on cell phone.  do not have wifi presently here at the farm
don't want to create a trail to anyone else until i can get to the root of the problem
having issues with email and ok chat site since posting grandpa on chat yesterday.  coincidence or ???
Gotcha 1patriot
Gotta love the media....
looked to me that there were 2 million there on 1-6.  but the media doesn't talk about that.  if there was any intent for insurrection - there wouldn't be anything standing inside their present military compound.  imo pig-schu-mitch orchestrated, staged the event to provide the narrative for the impeachment
Agreed. That Antifa idiot out in Utah was arrested and released and then did more stupid stuff.
only patriots remain in custody while real perps walk?  nothin to see here folks
let's see ... we are dealing with a criminal cabal ... a giant version of the Capone gang ... hmmm
Exactly. All that happened over the summer last year and has started again in Portland and they are being let off. Unreal. It‚Äôs a sign that sadly the majority of the American population is missing
resolution to the problem is on a level ABOVE the problem
Yes but no one above wants to resolve. No leadership in sight anymore
so does that mean the resolution is to protect ourselves and be safely at a distance - tucked away in remote areas - and wait until they annihilate one another?
there is always a falling out amongst thieves
I have some hope that even on their side there is a line they will not go across and even they say enough is enough. But some will blindly follow like in Nazi Germany. I know that from first hand accounts from my time over there. As far as protection, we always must do that but that is also why some here want to start organizing better for protection and to keep alive whatever we can and hopefully this will pass
Already have seen some on the left not willing to bow down and of course the Rinos that can‚Äôt live up to their promises in speeches
if gun grab legis passes -
I know.... concerned to say the least
this has separated the wheat from the chaff - many who i thought were friends have turned out to be marxists - even family
Sad but I believe it. The scamdemic has done that as well. People willingly giving up in the name of ‚Äúscience‚Äù is so annoying and frustrating
i guess they haven't read / understand ATLAS SHRUGGED.  i want to read part 3 again cuz i think the resolution to all this is there
There are lot of people who do not remember holding the line against the Commies or have experienced a communist society. I have and it‚Äôs fool hardy to believe any of this that is going on but that‚Äôs what you get with a bad education, I mean indoctrination system. Saw that when I was teaching as well. Always tell folks I left because of the adults not the kids
My students would come with history questions all the time and what they taught was not the history I learned. Period
He's not kidding either! 
i grew up in the midwest and west - but did not ever learn real history until moving to the deep south
Well not down here any more not in the system I taught in. We could not fail anyone we had to upgrade the student to a D no matter what
history, economics, logic, civics have not been a part of ed since dept of ed created - dept of propaganda is what i call it
True statement
there is no education in public schools
Not anymore no
boiling of the frog operation has been underway since 1812 and has escalated with each generation
Are you down here in the South still?
Roger NC here on the SC line
ms & ar is where i started to learn the REAL story - incl about cw
The victor gets to write the history so seeing it from this perspective is good and you get a better sense of what was going on leading up to it
first encounter with southern lit -- i was shocked
i see the same thing happening now -- diff costumes, hairdo's -- sos (same old story)
I am already thinking of where to move if these gun bills pass the Senate. Are there any sanctuary states for 2A?
It‚Äôs the same for me with WW II. Once I was in Germany and spoke with Germans that were around during Nazi times they told me how it was for them and how they almost couldn‚Äôt refuse fearing the Nazis.
the left does not know anything but the propaganda they've been spoon fed -- and have no desire to learn either -- they are hypnotized by carrots
I can only hope that IF these pass, then a lawsuit will be immediately filed like for the immigration deportations by a state AG or 2 and put a hold on some it
And yes gre I have heard some states passing what amounts to sanctuary status laws for 2A
i think az is a 2A sanc -- but it is too close to the hotbed for me
ty 81
Sounds good.  I live in Central Texas near Temple.  We spend time (400 miles a month) biking around Salado TX and beer at the Barrows Brewery...
Thanks gre81!
I know of some counties here in NC that are but I don‚Äôt think our state will be. Too many lefties in Charlotte, Raleigh, Greensboro
I think we need more than just counties being a sanctuary. We need states to declare this
True I think some legislators are in some states like Missouri is one that comes to mind
I am not sure they can pull it off and get away clean. But time will tell
I'll do some more investigating and let you know.
enlightening for sure -- gives me hope that if dc goes for the gun grab -- it will not have a substantial impact
when it comes down to it -- county sheriff rules, not dc
True unfortunately our Sheriff here is not a very constitutional sheriff
lazy sheriffs want to pass their responsibilities up the chain -- but we hold the power to replace them
Jbrown1118 I have not heard anything about SR today. Been in here most of today
easier to replace them than politicos
I hope ours can be replaced soon I believe next election 2022
And he‚Äôs not really lazy he is just in bed with the dimwits. He drank the Kool Aid. Came right and said he will not cooperate with ICE

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=76SroZ2LcLGsTMdTi) The Kenneth Harrelson from FL and in federal custody is 40 years old. The one from IL in the obituary died at 80 years old.
Hello, new member, would have been here sooner but google puts everything from oathkeepers into my spam, Was hoping to try and start getting in touch with good people near Spartanburg area South Carolina, any help towards that would be appreciated.
Thanks for heads up DaveyE7.    I can verify this website is valid and confirmed legit.
#SC  <<< click/tap on that @Jordon_Janelle, join that group and introduce yourself. Alternately, for the sake of learning to navigate, tap on the globe at the top of the pane on the left, scroll until you find your state and select, or else use the magnifying glass to search for #SC.... Don't expect a response as it's pretty slow today, even in this chat room... but here is where you'll spend most of your time
My sympathies to Kenneth Wayne Harrelson --- may he rest in peace.    Meanwhile Kenneth Troy Harrelson remains in custody in Florida as a political prisoner.
Guaranteed theres a grave with everybody's name on it somewhere..pretty common thing....
Apologize for not addressing this issue earlier but I had my Saturday chores and just now was made aware of the discrepancy.    For anyone else who might still think this is a scam --     https://www.mynews13.com/fl/orlando/news/2021/03/11/kenneth-harrelson-capitol-riot-charges
Ok just repeating what was said earlier had not heard there was a confirmation
I thought that might be the case as there can be multiple people with same names. I was telling Chris what was said earlier is all. Thanks for the clarification!
Hey xraystar from Charlotte, NC. Spend a lot of time driving around the Carolinas and am that direction quite a bit. Welcome, as bravo said get on your state thread and introduce yourself. SC is a little thin but there
No problem at all.    More info to confirm -   https://www.mynews13.com/fl/orlando/news/2021/03/11/kenneth-harrelson-capitol-riot-charges

Hello all. Glad to be here. I'm a bit south of Spartanburg personally.
Again welcome xraystar
NIce to meet you Davey. I think i'm not the only one in SC who has been complacent and is starting to snap out of it. Didn't realize open carry wasn't legal here until recently.
Yes that‚Äôs true I was surprised but believe it or not it is legal here in NC. Maybe not tactically sound imho
Maybe not, but someone I was talking to recently made a really good point, if you see people walking around carrying in grocery stores, etc. and people aren't getting shot it helps take away the 2A stigma and force people to begin to question their world views.
True but I have had people freak out because I was talking about guns let alone carrying one. When I taught self defense when that topic came up it always was a long discussion
Those folks wanted to know what to do so it was usually a good discussion
It's a good discussion to have, definitely benefits to both lines of thinking, but either way I want to have the option for either!
True and I have open carried before just not often
The wife is calling. So long for now o/
A little humor
We used Wickr back a few years ago on the recommendation of our NC leader at the time
Not sure if that is around or secure anymore
And I think that is starting to become a consensus here
I have always all for getting more organized rather than lone solid uses trudging along
And that said I am out for now, may be back later on gotta feed kids! Stay safe all

My take from what SR said was that..there are way more OK members on the downlow than what anybody sees..used iceberg analogy..that the leadership are the public face of this thing and those of us that are alone should start locally and build this thing that way...correct?
Back on. I agree we need to start at the local level. Even back when I first joined it was this way, now maybe a little worse based on events. That‚Äôs what I was talking about earlier today about feeling alone and losing hope. Some locations are better organized than others. Face to face recruiting and vetting IS needed. And I agree with SR and his iceberg theory. I saw an article today that like over 60% of Americans are unhappy about government actions etc but afraid to voice their opinions. This is what they want. It has happened countless times in history.
And I will put it out there like greywolf did earlier today, I would much rather be a follower than a lead but I will take that on if need be to get started. I have posted more today than I ever did back a few years ago because circumstances change for all of us and I refuse to give up what I gave 20 years of my life defending. I am disappointed in our military leadership and that inspires me to come forward now
Any OK‚Äôs in Mecklenburg or surrounding areas dm me and I will try my best to get us started and organized for our nation, for us all. Any admins, any help you can give would be appreciated. I will do what I can with what time I have.

@peacemaker45 Hey Peacemake45. Hope all is good on the Western Slope
I habe spoken to people that have benn an ok for years without physically meeting another ok..thats just unacceptable
Not being a card carrying member might not be a bad thing right now. Not having a card or sticker doesn‚Äôt change my perspective on things. My focus is still on my ‚Äúmilitia‚Äù of lifelong family and friends that I can trust. Unfortunately, a majority have died or moved.
...i agree  researcher i am an oath keeper because of the oath i took at the MEPS on my way to  parris island 30 years ago..not from a card in my pocket
I  am an oathkeeper..not because of a card in my pocket,  but because i keep the oath i took 30 years ago at MEPS on way to parris island
Same here. I have been paying monthly for almost a year and never received anything.
Ill never forget it....they kept us in a hotel
There were kids from all branches leaving out
As we filed in for physicals and such....air force got a breathalyzer....army got a breathalyzer....
Navy and marine..nah go on thru...
If the Senate passes the more draconian gun bills, that means the filibuster is gone and the floodgates of socialist legislation have opened. The only safe state will be a former state.
Don‚Äôt really care if they send me a card or not was not the reason I joined. I joined for what the organization stands for.
I love this..check it out......I am a United States military veteran.
I mastered the weapons, tools, and techniques of war and security and I make no apology for the proficiency.
I became a leader by my willingness to both serve and subordinate myself to my superiors‚Äô, the mission and the needs of my team.
Foremost among first responders, I earned the ribbons of a volunteer, endeavor, defender, warrior, rescuer, problem-solver, and model citizen.
I am the visible conscience of a nation with regard to the costs of war and freedom‚Äôs true price.
I do not fail to support another vet who crosses my path with any need, large or small; he or she may have wounds or hardships that few others would understand.
I am part of the eternal flame of memory, of my brother and sister veterans who died in service to our country.
Honor, courage, and commitment define me to this day.  I maintain my readiness, health, and fitness in order to serve again, should my community or nation call.
In all of the remaining moments of my life, I will be steadfast guardian of American ideals, freedoms, and history.
I am a one-percenter of the noblest order.  I am‚Ä¶ an American veteran.

Mr. Buckley here. Just checking in...
Sorry guys this thing is saying I‚Äôm heartwood but it‚Äôs Mr. Buckley 
Ok I think I got it fixed 
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=cBzSxvVRvIMB57JwL) Hi Mr. Buckley
Welp, I have a bike too (Harley Street Glide)
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=Ea7t7nXbPXBSAMCW5) I have to agree with what you have said. For far too long this movement has resembled the "People's Front of Judea" from Monty Python's Life of Brian when it comes to actually acting on anything.
Gents face to face vetting is the direction we are moving.  Sadly we have been dealing with one thing after another for years, and while the org has done much good work in many places it has not been able to get all the structure and paid staff in place that groups like the NRA or GOA have in place.  ```

```
I have been a member since 2013, and while I have a card and some stickers that is pretty much all I have.  I am not standing with my brothers and sisters in this org not because of getting "stuff" or a news letter or any of that, but to be able to support each other even if it is at a distance.  ```
```
Ask not what the org can do for you, ask what you can do for Oath Keepers and your brothers and sisters.  If you do not know any other OK folk in your area reach out in your state chat on this site and network.  If there is no state leader for your state's chat let me or any other administrator know.  National leadership is working on vetting all members, and that starts with vetting of state points of contact.  State POCs will be vetting folks in their states.
Even without face to face contact with other members there is much you can do.   We will need letters written to elected officials, even if you personally do not believe they will listen we still have to do it.  We will need to raise funds for defense purposes.  We will need to provide physical security for patriots families who have gotten death threats while their head of house have been locked up.
I am not sure what you are getting at.  Can you provide me with some more details.  No changes have been made to the chat in the last 48 hours.
Good Morning.
I'm a fairly new member with a few questions if you have the time to answer them about the kit, state chats, and possible ways to be more active on the local level if you have the time.
Email sent!
Good Morning Florida!
New 2 the group...checking in from SW mn
Any new Members please go to the top , click on the globe which is the Directory, find your state and introduce yourself
Lets not forget our Member in FL in our donations and prayers this Sunday.
You can donate with any name you choose or anonymously
I dont know.....here in North Georgia  not only are we rednecks but hillbillies as well.
Can you add johnp65 as a Mod in our #GA chat?  He is one of our State POC's.  I tried myself and cant figure it out.
In this age of technology..a handwritten letter has ALOT of power...imsgine what 10,000 handwritten letters to congress might do
Or a letter released from each State at the same time in support of OK and Stewart prior to his interviews.
From Stewart yesterday...
Heads up!   Gateway Pundit is going to publish an interview with Kenny‚Äôs wife, Angel.  She is writing up a statement now.  Most likely it will be published on Monday.   So keep your fingers crossed that it gets as much response as the one on Josh.  

also, Kellye SoRelle and I are doing a video interview tomorrow with Gateway Pundit that should also be published on Monday. 

We will push the need for patriots to stand up and support ALL who entered the Capitol.
Face to face vetting is the awnser....there are good solid men and women out here...who...on paper might look like a no or you might have a good man with a bad rep locally..maybe the local sheriff has a grudge or something. And that guy would be missed because of it...face to face vetting will allow the vetting officer to physically make a decision.....when we get to this point...our orginization will definitely be better off.
We use a paid for background check to Vett. We have the Member send us a copy of their DL and Carry and enter it into the background check.  We review that and the social media accounts in the report and if we cant meet face to face do a phone interview as well. The interview is written up and the background reports are placed into our Vetting folder to be reviewed by Leadership.  The person is voted on than if Passed moved into the Vetted folder
Im sure it's thorough...im just afraid we lose good men thru the cracks......threepers locally here were jerks...i had beef with one...30 years ago i kicked his at football game....busted him up real good in front of 2 whole schools.......here we r as adults and guess what...they said no....guess who the vetting officer was..bingo.......what a pussy!!!
Good advise sky
They cant eat me or take my birthday away..so fuck em!!!!
I know right!
Im gonna reiterate a comment from my 8 year old son..its the whole reason im Getting involved now and not 10 years ago..he heard me and momma fighting about my involvement...Daddy..if theres a war..i dont want them to fight in our yard..plz make it happen somewheres else....powerful stuff man!
Thats why its si importamt that we as OKs dont just spout some bullshit rhetoric on here.....
Dont rhink i dont want to shout to the mountain tops about whats going on...im a big dude. Hair down to my ass...long beard...6ft 260..when i start shouting..even when im not doing it angry...people are wary...inhave to be careful about how i carry myself......first impressions are paramount
Thats like discord?
its a game chat
its used for cross platform gaming
much like element
But you wont beable to see all of it until you are actually vetted and its nota free for all like this
Ok i see.....thnx brother
this is the web page that is being made to help people grasp our goals
its better viewed on Lap top of PC as the mobile ver is set yet
I did do some "vetting" of organizations....3% was my first choice...but as i said...my local group deffered me....i have quite a reputation locally for not putting up with dumb shit and small town stuff kept me out
Ive been know to smack the shit outta somebody runnin that lip if they dont shut up...im much better now that im all grown up...but that shit follows a man around his whole life...
The old three was a mixed up mess of many things and its been in the works for a while to restructure, they actual all broke apart after the capitol and changed there name to APC. This is the guys that got together and want to learn multiple things from Radios, canning, homesteading, defensive ability's, disaster assistance, child recovery and to be able to respond and support their local community's when the time is needed. Thats the short of it, we are not looking to over throw anything and we believe in the American way and the best for all. Its on the ground floor so its a good time to start out
Doing the right thing and putting people in their place is a needed skill and we all have had to do it we just got older and more stylish
Thats awsome..thats what im talkin about....im training to start joining search and rescue teams here from the state
Im proficiant in all of those sir...im gonna check it out...
The most recent example is the border issue in TX, we were getting ready for several states to roll out and help after direct com with heads of agincies and guys in the ground in texas, then texas stepped up and is working to solve the issues, our only goal is to bb the help and strength that is needed and to ensure good people do not have to live in fear
Check it out is you ever want to
Thats amazing guy.....ill look into it....
sounds good, stay safe I dont spend much time in here it really doesnt move past the part you see each day being talked about and it is very much monitored, which is not a big deal because no one I have met is trying to over throw anything they are just patriotic guys with no direction. Nice talking to ya

Is It Time for Red States To Start Using Their Power to Nullify Federal Law? https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2021/03/13/is-it-time-for-red-states-to-start-using-their-power-to-nullify-federal-law/
Thanks Based in Texas. All these threads have ever been it seems like are gripe sessions and that has led to the isolation they want us to have. I have felt that way the whole time I have been a member and that part of the reason I let me membership lapse a few years but in light of what has happened since November I cannot sit idly by any longer.
I am new to the group and when I saw "movement" I am not even referring specifically to OK - I am referring to the entire right in general.
Totally agree jpj
Exactly jpj this is all too important. The lives of our children and our collective futures are at stake. I have many reasons for doing this and wanting to get more active now but stickers and my card are not in that list for sure
It might be but I agree with one of the comments, I do not think the Republicans would do. They only grow a spine when it is good for them and they can gain something. Not all but most I would guess
Any southern CAL folks great opportunity for you.

Hello all
Situation could have been handled better and without police totally agree on that. But as he stated arrogance
@peacemaker45 That was great! And very true (especially the part about no comms being secure, but its all we got, for the moment right?). It is really mostly "information warfare," at this point, as you say, but people are getting very edgy and they definitely are nowhere near waking up to what we see yet. I just hope it will be as easy a battle as you think it will be. Example of what I'm speaking of....
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cI0I5Rk30
To the 3 letter people tracking and watching here..we just want to be left alone to live in the America that supposed to be......nobody here wants to overthrow shit...do you realize how much work that would be....you guys are working for the wrong side..come on....i really just wanna sit on my porch and watch my youngans play as the wind blows the hayfield across the road from me ,and  occasionally make love to my wife ...are we askin so much...
Not at all WKNC totally agree!
And good morning three letter people!
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=8hC2uYAu8w7sKkqWi) Me too...lol
My youngans are why at this point I am doing this. Threatening their future is my line in the sand. Couple that with lack of leadership at multiple levels well that‚Äôs down right ridiculous. It was all starting when I retired from the military back in ‚Äò09 and it‚Äôs gotten deeper and deeper
Great message this morning at CCCH regarding "the times of the signs" if you missed it on again 930 and 1200 PST
I was asked to be POC for Wa state by either Tom in Georgia or Make Adams months ago but nothing really came of it. Met a small group of guys on the westside and we keep in touch. Not sure if anyone knows this. I am a non vet, non leo, and in my mind just a placeholder until someone competent comes along to lead.
ok.  may just be a technical issue here.  was not sure if my post caused a problem there.

In the boiler plate training material for the great "purge", this sums up the focus of their efforts for which it requires someone to strain to include the likes of Antifa or BLM into their definition of "extremists" or "gangs", especially since the examples they provide makes mention of only "white supremacists". ÔÇ∑ Dignity and Respect: The Department of Defense places the highest importance on treating
all personnel with dignity and respect, in an inclusive environment, free from impermissible
discrimination, harassment, and hate. And as such, DoD policy expressly prohibits Service
members from actively advocating supremacist, extremist, or criminal gang doctrine,
ideology and causes. The Department of Defense also holds its civilian workforce to the
highest standards of character and conduct required to protect and promote the public
trust.
ÔÇ∑ Service members must reject active participation in organizations that advance
supremacist or extremist ideology, which includes those that advance, encourage, or
advocate illegal discrimination based on race, creed, color, sex, religion, ethnicity, or
national origin, or those that advance, encourage, or advocate the use of force,
violence, or criminal activity or otherwise advance efforts to deprive individuals of their
civil rights. (DoDI 1325.06, Encl. 3, para 8.b.)
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=iJmPZrfNcBuLxcLkv) Just WOW! There has never been systemic racism or "extremism" in the military. The Marines are being seriously gas-lighted! The purge is upon us
This is what was talking about. With the purging in the obummer admin of patriotic officers loyal to the constitution we now have political appointees more of less running things. And it is trickling down thru the SNCO/PO ranks of the entire military into the rank and file. I fear an Operation Valkeryie may not happen.
You‚Äôre welcome
It is in the works.  SR has a plan.  We are starting to implement that plan, but like everything it takes time and folks have to remember  most folks doing things here are volunteers.
Be back on a little later folks stay safe
SR has asked me to set up some things for him to be able to securely vet folks for POC while he travels.  I am working on it.  I expect things will start as a trickle in the next couple of weeks, then build.
Feel free to ask.

Hey, I never received the email.
i am heartened to know that only a small percentage of patriots kicked out the brits in 1776 -- and by how many were in dc on 1/6.  we can and will do this when the time is right.  prepare
Windy my line has been drawn. With gun control coming closer each day and the threat to my children‚Äôs future well I don‚Äôt think it will take much anymore for a lot of folks even not involved in this site
Not even close to an inssurection
I will be happy to get SR‚Äôs plan moving and help however I can. Face to face vetting does need to start as soon as we all can at the local level.
Sorry -- just sent
Tucker hit a nerve and is correct. The military is not a social experiment. It‚Äôs purpose is to defend us from all enemies foreign and domestic. This bs started up as I was retiring en masse. Had a situation with a subordinate I had to counsel and get on his case several times. Well even after I retired I still had to defend my actions. Such horse crap...
I just saw something in the scroll at the bottom of the screen when watching OANN that Biden is looking into stripping college students of their Due Process Rights.  I am of the opinion that this might very well be a trial balloon where they see what pushback they get.  If there is little to no peaceful pushback from Americans on this, Biden and his handlers may use this as precedent to strip others of their Due Process Rights.  I have no other details yet, but keep an eye on this one.  If I get more details, I will post them with what sources I find.
Here are a few sources for the above post.

@1patriot , do you know a ham operator in your area?
FCC shows 7 ham operators in Vernon.
Do you know John Dettra Jr. or Thomas McCoy, in Vernon? They're ham operators.

So, the question is...... is this the interview that SR said he had to get ready for, said he would return the next day to continue the convo, and still hasn't returned?
@bravo-echo , SR stepped in the chat for a short time that next morning.
Yeah? I guess I somehow missed it, or (not to worry myself) might have forgotten. Was there any mention of this interview with TGP then, or since then?
Naw. Short meeting. Promised to return later that day. If he did, I didn't catch him.
Calling out to NEW GUYS...

Feel free to say hi. What state are you in?
Keeping.AZ. Who do I talk to on here about the new member packet? SR said here would get in in touch with the person but he is obviously a very busy guy. Just wondering if anyone else new who handles that?
Oh by bikes I thought you meant motorcycles
ahhh - thanks.  will research

@nomad1776 things are a bit in disarray at this point.  Oath Keepers is having trouble just transacting business due to issues with credit card processing and banking.  I am not sure when new member packets will be moving again.  The new member packet consisted of membership card, some stickers and a pocket constitution when I got mine years ago. More important than the swag is getting to work!

@1patriot which is of course why I have not heard the message.  Perhaps if you know it you can share it.
f--k biden and you who voted for him
jpj how do we direct that energy from bikers to harrelson?
That is a good question.  Perhaps we have some bikers in the OK crew.  Maybe rolling thunder to the Capitol?
Perhaps I will have to put plates on my bike again.

New member packets won't be coming for some time. Between the deplatforming and fallout from Jan 6th, top brass is scrambling. Best thing to do right now is try to connect to your state leader or ANYONE in your state. And continue prepping, especially comms, while brass cleans things up.
Vernon is so small, you might just want to ask around. Someone is bound to know Dettra or McCoy. You won't be able to contact them via ham radio bands without having a ham operator's license.

Yes indeed, it was. And some of our guys got swept right up in it. Just reality we now have to deal with. As I said last night, it was dumb to go inside, but that doesn't make them criminals, not when they walked through doors already open (and some of the doors were opened by police).

it was a cluster fuck. And I admit I got caught off guard. I had no clue any of our men were going inside, and it didn't even cross my mind that any might. My mistake. and it won't happen again. We will be tightening up our command and control considerably. That being said, being dumb is still not a crime.

AaronMT doesn't seem to even be in the roster anymore....
I am a Navy man.  He is a hero of mine.  He was one of the reasons I was inspired to go to the academy.  He had to hide his identity, JPJ was not his real name.  I have to hide my identity because it could be a problem for me if it was known in professional circles I am associated.

@broberg, It'll take time for the chats to gain momentum again after the de-platforming. Some states are more active than others. In the meantime, glad you're here in the General.
So I am looking at mustering a small army to work on the wikipedia article about Oath Keepers.  There is an army of leftists and propaganda folk that put disinformation on wikipedia.  We need to combat that.  Sadly wikipedia requires sources outside the org for any info posted about the org.  I ran into that problem with a non-profit I ran where we were trashed on wikipedia and when we corrected the info wikipedia eventually removed the page.
Yup, there's three of you in there. Makes perfect sense lol
@dgiesel , WELCOME!
So we need to show things good that we have done with documentation from articles about us that are not sourced from our web site.
and there's 6 in #MO
We also need to show that we are multiracial and not white supremicists.

Thanks so much.  People always point at wikipedia about us.  It will be a real fight.  The bad guys will try and change things back.  Best strategy is changing things a little at a time I think.
I've never contributed info to Wiki pages. I'm guessing it's intuitive. Just start? Or would you like me to forward articles to you before posting to Wiki?
Well it is not really about posting articles there.  What you have to do is edit the page and use the article you found as a footnote.  Probably a good place to start is reading the article fully even though it is disgusting.
Roger that.
I am setting up a room for this.  Expect an invite.

Just watched Stuarts interview. Non-Vet, non-LEO, but really glad to be a part of this organization. Thanks to all of you for your service. Hope i can formally take the oath at some point.
@jpj , Great interview with TheGatewayPundit.com (Jim Hoft) and 100PercentFedUp.com (Patty McMurray). BIG thanks to Jim and Patty for their courage to tell the story and ask the questions REAL JOURNALIST ask to serve the public and the truth.
I am thinking we need to start on wikipedia by getting "burner" email addresses to register with wikipedia.   My suggestion is to get one with an off shore provider.  I know folks love proton, but they have the downside for these purposes of wanting you to prove identity.  If they ever decide to cooperate with anyone they have real info.  Two other off shore providers are safe-mail.net (sort of older clunky interface, but works) and tutanota.com.
Why the burner addresses?
Folks pass that interview link around.  We need to use grass roots organizing to get the word out.  Do not bother sending to far left folks, but send to moderates you know.
Because if wikipedia ties the truth back to folks associated with the org they purge it.  I had a non-profit I was with.  We caught someone on the staff peeping at women in the bathroom.  We fired him, then he set about to make the non-profit look bad on wikipedia.  When we went to correct they figured out we were associated with the org.  Wikipedia tries to act all psudo academia and say if you are involved directly you can not provide the info.
Got it.
Note they have the OK entry locked.  They are slanting it to the left that way anyway.
Then we have to each find some other non-related pages to edit.  I started looking last night.
Have not registered yet though
No, I haven't registered to begin the work.
Right....I was saying I have not registered.  I just started to look for pages I might be able to contribute to.
I'll go grab a burner email.

Sadly there is no place in NY that is actually safe and follows the constitution, but upstate is far better than NYC.

Great I will look into that!  Need something to spend sleepy joes money on LOL! Thanks
@nomad1776 , could you be more specific? Do you want to simply receive (Rx) or receive and transmit (Rx/Tx)? Local or distant?
that' it zhtod.  noticed harrelson surpassed goal.  being extradited to dc for trial.
Receive and transmit. Local
@nomad1776 get any 2 watt FRS unit.  FCC last year changed FRS rules and raised power from 1/2 watt to 2 watts and expanded channels from 14 to all the GMRS channels.  Getting an FRS instead of GMRS means no $35 every 10 years to the FCC and also no FCC knowledge you have the radios
Should be good to about 5 miles on flat open ground.  More of one of you is on a mountain, less with obstructions.  I get 1/2 to 1 mile in NYC, but at 1 mile it is pretty spotty
Thanks jpj. 
def buy abut five to ten cheep radios with a 2 to 5 mile zone and hand them out on scene
What is it jpj you would like to do with NY
Theory teaches us that hand held radio at 5'6" above the ground has a distance to the horizon of 2.9 miles over flat ground or the ocean.  That means two radios should communicate twice that far if the ground is flat.  It never is.  In practical terms from doing radio for more than 40 years do not count on more than 2-2.5 miles, especially of guys have their radio on their belts when not transmitting.  Suggest everyone put them on their shoulder straps with the antenna clear of their body.
Must watch!!
whatever radio you get you need to be able to hand it out with very little user knowledge on it this is why radios your common store clerks use work best for the types of events you may be at, work with the guys you know and buy the same brand
watching now
Got it
what is you plan you have plenty of guys standing by and you have admin by your name
.you can preprogram then hand them out they are idiot proof if set up correctly
that is exactly what you need because we all know radio goes to shit in real world
These are tough too..70 mph off my hood ..barely a scratch
nice, I have had my radio kicked out of my hand when calling for back up so depend on nothing but skill is your best option
guy could throw a hell of a kick though
Shit..I thought i had a brother near me..
be safe guys and question everything here that acts like its running something
we started with the Bricks
massive radios
better then the night stick for use of force
No radio you can program with chirp is legal for any unlicensed use and they should not be used in connection with any Oath Keepers operations.
@stewart-rhodes is very serious about keeping it all legal.
thats why the simple radios are the best option
Very few inexpensive radios that can be programed with chirp are legal for part 90 licensed operations, and OK does not have a part 90 license.  Like I said a 2 watt FRS radio is what you want for local comms for events.
buy the cheap Arshell AR-6 radios on amazon they fall into what your talking about
buy five and have them on hand
they are UHF
Well I expect I will be meeting with all these strong in NY folks then.  I will be starting with the few folks in NYC, then move out to Nassua and Suffolk and progress north after that.
16 channel already programed
Then we should meet
Where in the state are you?
I will say I have very specific instructions from SR on meeting folks face to face, as do folks in other parts of the country.
Didnt know that
As do I
Thanks for 411

Lol somewhat close but not around the corner, come over and have a beer close
There are no active OK in NY just a few people that get on here and have for over two years now. So I am not about to go dumping info on this platform knowing how compromised it is, if you actual want NY up then youll need to do more then have a few titles by your name, no offense but I have plenty of titles to./
Please explain to me how the platform is compromised and how you know that to be true?
you are able to have any radio you want and listen to it, you only can get smacked by the FCC if you abuse it our talk on licensed channels, any ham operator will tell you that in the event of all out fall of the government no on is going to dick you for getting on the radio
pick up a Baofeng UV-5R MK5 on amazon for about 40.00
it comes with the cable to program it and the chirp is free on the web
Similar to what I have...
perfect its all you need and wooo you get to hear some old guys talk about there lives once and awhile
I love it....use it as a scanner
Checking out.
I just use the FM function for music, I learned a long time ago that to complicated means to much of a pain, I want to push the button and have you here me not do anything else, pulse you can program the simple UHF into it anyways
because every single thing we typed on here prior to the 6th was plastered all over the internet
and anyone can join
So you have no knowledge then is what you are telling me.  I do have some knowledge.  I know you have no name in the membership roster and how are things on Ledyard road these days.
You will note there is no join button on the chat login page.
And I was not handling any OK tech prior to the 6th.
since the FBI was here which is you at this point for knowing that
then you have seen the video of me fighting the bastards that tried taking the capitol and saving the officers inside
thanks for blowing that up
As I said gents the Baofeng UV-5R is not legal for any unlicensed purposes, and is no longer part 90 certified for commercial licensed land mobile either.  The recommendation for OK operations is 2 watt FRS radios.  Oath Keepers has a very strict keep it legal policy and what @skydivinglawman is suggesting is a federal felony.
Any GA guys know where to get 9MM in GA these days.  I have a widow of a USAF NCO who asked me where to find it for her and her boys (18-24).  She says she has not been able to find it anywhere and she only has one mag of 9, same thing for her boys.  Yes the 18 yo is allowed a hand gun.  He is a cop.
They are about 45 min from Atlanta
I'll tell you one thing ,I'm in central Ohio and we need to organize. As far as I know there's no leadership here.Anybody?
I agree oldcorps73. I have been trying since I joined to talk to anyone. We need to get something going soon. 
What about the baofeng GT-22? You can get a 4 pack on Amazon for $40. 
None of the baofeng are legal without a license
as far as I know
Let me look at that specific model
BTW in case some of you think I am just blowing smoke about radio I have had both ham and commercial licenses form most of my life and I am an old fart by some estimations, but I can still fight, F**K and run a foot race.
Ok had a look at the GT-22.  They seem to be legal FRS radios, but some of the other makers have units that will preform better.  Antenna size is important.  GT-22 has a tiny little antenna.  Try to find an FRS radio with a 6 inch antenna.  6 inches is full sized for FRS frequencies.
Looks like since the feds shut down the Free Flow of the UV-5 for part 90 ops baofeng moved to making FRS radios in addition.
Thank jpj. I‚Äôll keep looking. 
But I have very serious doubts about the quality of the Baofeng units for any serious use.
Give me a moment and let me find the link about baofeng
http://shaken-not-stirred.tekhq.com/blog/index.cgi?mode=viewone&blog=1488684251  That is about the uv-5r, but I have no reason to believe that an even cheaper radio from the same company is any better.  I have opened up the uv-5r.  Not a tuned circuit to speak of in the damn thing.  Makes it shit in cities.
I have seen Motorola and Cobra FRS radios that I suspect would be much better.  They also have bigger antenna, which is important.
I was just about to ask about that jpj. I was having a hard time finding one with a 6‚Äù antenna. 
My own FRS are audiovox 1/2 watt units with only 14 channels.  Have had them for years, but they just keep working.  Will probably get some newer 22 channel 2 watt units when I get a job.
The closer to 6 inches the better.
6 inches is a 1/4 wave antenna on 460Mhz.  Anything less and you give up some effeciency
I will pass that on to them.  Widow just got a some ammo from someplace out west that someone sent me in PM.
I need no ammo.  The commies already disarmed me.  I live in NYC
Have you ever stood in times square and tried to use them?  For that matter have you ever used them  on the Brooklyn Bridge, or in any other high RF density area such as you find in big cities?
If not I strongly suggest you read the article.
When the shit hits the fan the FCC isn‚Äôt going to be handing out tickets for illegal radio use 
@jbrown1118 you just admitted to a felony.
Not if he has a license 
They are not type accepted for FRS or GMRS
The only place they are legal for use are by licensed hams on ham frequencies.  BF lost their part 90 type acceptance, and that did not cover part 95 services in any case
The point is any stuff done as an official Oath Keepers event you can not be using radios that are not legal for the purpose and frequencies.
If you happen to be doing nothing wrong except using an illeegal radio do you want to go through a felony trial and eventual conviction when you can buy legal radios?
You heard wrong @jbrown1118
From an operational point of view if you are using a uv-5r and are not in a city it should work OK until it falls apart.  They do not hold up to daily use.
Ok, not to change the subject from comms but is there a list of approved/suggested/endorsed equipment or load out items? If not I think it might be a good thing to create for new members and would also keep uniformity throughout the organization. 
Very informative talk...i had no idea...thank you jpj...radio gone!
I am in the Communist King co. Snohomish co. rules when it comes to patriots in Washington! I go up there and train with others once a month. great training and a great trainer.
One suggestion , that we all log on at the same time so we can have a real time chat. I doubt this is secure but we can still chat because I for one intend no illegal activity.
Comms...24hrfood and water.....IFak.....dry socks.....ect...ect....
I'm surprised that little detail was never mentioned in the official cpt-comms group before the deplat. Those radios were all the talk of the town.
Yeah things like that but I was thinking something more......formal. Maybe a PDF list? That way it can be archived, updated, and downloaded for use. 
Uo till today ive never heard it
Very correct tho
.did some lookin
There used to be folders, with lots of info. I don't know if it were ever archived, if it could be restored.
BTW due to covid-19 FCC has allowed for online HAM Technician Exam.  I used these guys to take the exam online last month.  I'm an electrical engineer so I know half the information on the exam.  Anyone can take this and pass it.   https://glaarg.org/
I would not mind getting together with others. Yes, these chat groups can be kind of scary these days. ;)
Who could this be suggested to so we could get this back?
were the folders/files in the various cpt groups archived before the deplatform?
That‚Äôs a good suggestion. I myself, check the chat frequently from 5pm to 11:00pm. So I would be good with anytime with in there. I also get on a few times during the day work permitting. 
Cost is $10 there a HAM exam app you can download to study the exact test pool of 428 questions with only 35 on the exam.  https://hamexam.org/exam/15-Technician
lol it is pretty easy
Download the HAM exam questions app to android or iphone...go through the questions and focus only on the correct answers
I downloaded the app on Monday...scheduled my exam for the next Sunday...studied about 2hrs a day for 3 days, then 1hr a day reviewing only the correct answers.  A guy on youtube recommended this Exam Cram model.  I probably have some advantage because of my dad allways have linears around growing up, so I had a pretty good base of information and I understand electrics.
I'd say roughly 7 or 8 hours.
Get the license then you can be legit
The big deal is access to repeaters...it opens up the entire planet
If it is something that needs to be recreated I would be willing to assist as much as I can. 
They were not.
baofengs are great starter radios, you can get bigger antennas and then get bigger bases stations, 50w mobiles for you bug out vehicle
We had no chance
Roger that
We did have a backup of the rocket chat, but there was something wrong with it and it would not reload.
If there is a room that should be created let me know.
I'm a comm guy (satellite) so that's the only one I even bothered to browse. But there were several CPT.... I'll ask around and see if I might know someone who was more intimate with what they were, and what was in them
will let you know....
seems they'll have to be re-created
bummer, but that's why God invented Marines! Improvise, overcome, adapt!
Hamstudy.org is my favored tool. free.
Roy Watson is the HamRadioExam app on android
Any way I can help, I will. Can the leads provide some guidance or should we create a chat group to submit items that are then researched and submitted to the leads for review? Just throwing out some ideas of how to get this done for everyone‚Äôs benefit. 
A lot of good info on radios and comms tonight. Thanks all!
I was just trying to find a good radio to get......it blossomed into this. Very helpful. 
There was a naming convention that was used previously. I have a call-out to see if someone remembers better than myself what that was. With that, I have it primed to turn on. I'm not sure about admin after that, or adding files, etc. There may also be an alternative to re-inventing the wheel here, possibly another site already in development.
btw anyone can legally broadcast on any frequency in an emergency situation
Remind me
Will do. And if there is anything I can do let me know. 
What you can do for now if note down these links S4A1 and others is providing
you can also listen on any frequency...just can't transmit without a callsign assigned to a HAM Technician License or greater.
Forgive my ignorance but what is S4A1? Is that someone that is going to provide the links?
more free HAM info...echolink is an app you can install on your smart phone that allows you to connect to repeaters around the world of HAM users.  You can use it to find locals and repeaters near you
you can only access echolink via your FCC approved assigned callsign assigned to your HAM Technician License
he provided that HamExam.org link
Yeah I just seen that in the main chat. 
Sorry about that. 
Iowa_State_Comms provided the Hamstudy.org link
bummer having to reinvent the wheel
links like these should be kept on a document that can be accessed and then someone or ones would have to be responsible for maintaining it
I'm really too old for this shit lol
Yeah it does but I think it will be beneficial in the long run and it will give us a chance to be sure we have the best and most current on it. 
All this chat that's going on now would be best in that group, that way it isn't lost in all the irrelevant stuff in the main group
@Iowa_State_Comms You were here before the deplat? Were familiar with the names of the CPT groups?
I will keep these links saved and I will try to even log the chat in its entirety. You just let me know who to get it to once you guys have that figured out. 
Not 100% sure what you are referring to, can you elaborate?
something like that
Oh hell, its been months
there were several
but yeah, something along those lines
yeah months, I know the feeling
I was assume Medical, Security, Comms, Logistics, ect ect.
I would*
I asked and all the stuff wasn't archived
none of it
look at the literature
Out for the evening all. Stay safe and keep your head on a swivel
Oh, engineering too. thats basicly all of them.
I already made a  National Comms Vetted Channel
private, yes
someone already created a couple unvetted comms channels. were these supposed to take the place of the CPTs?
No idea, just saw that myself
Ok I logged the links but could not figure out how to copy all the chat without copying and pasting each comment into my notes. 
this is like learning how to walk again
lol yeah I was just looking at that
can't forward to another chat group
can't paste pictures
I will do my best to screen shot it for now and save it just in case in needs to be referenced latter. 
just experimenting, I don't know that this platform is yet capable of doing what we want
links, notable quotes... most important things right now
I have to be off for a bit... thanks for your concern and help, Chief
Ok well I just screen shot everything from the comms discussion. I will save them so we can reference them later and pull out what we want. 
Have a good one sir. Till we speak again. 
I use a credit card provider for my business that is very pro-1A and is a veteran owned business. It is called 2nd Amendment processing. They would almost certainly be able to help get processing back online.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=oyT7jXsSaRv9GzDsa) How does one go about being vetted?  I am new.
No, Steve everyone kind of posts when they can than checks back
Ok you need to get with bravo-echo and maybe Keeping.AZ. They seem to be some of the higher ups that are on here most of the time. If nothing else they should know who you need to get in touch with. 
Steve, if you would could you please send a picture of your DL and if you have one your Carry to TrustSeeker69@protonmail.com?   The way things are today we like to do a closer Vett of our new people to assure when we welcome them in all we all have a bit more security.  Once that is done we will have a talk than bring you on board!  I live over in Dawson County.
@BasedInTexas Start by joining the TX group.  Vetting will happen face to face with state POCs.
State POCs will be in the state channels as they are vetted by national.
The state POCs will vet folks face to face and will be asking to see certain documentation.
We are making sure that we do not fully admit any bad actors.
Or I should have said we are trying to make sure we do not fully admit bad actors.
That is why we will have chat channels restricted to fully vetted people.
Do you have a POC in Ohio currently. I am in the Ohio chat since getting on here and have posted that I was new and need to go through the motions. Have not seen or heard for anyone in regards to that yet so I was curious. 
I am really mostly one of the tech folks andI also handle some NY duties.  What SR has told me is that he is trying to vet state POCs for states that do not have them as fast as he can, but you might know that national leadership has a lot going on now.
I click on the globe and nothing happens. Trying to get to Texas room.

Lovejoym33, are you on the app or on by browser? Same thing happened to me so I had to download the app to see the chat rooms.

GREAT NEWS!   I just found out Oath Keeper Robert Minuta IS OUT ON BAIL!   He was on Roger Stone‚Äôs PSD detail on Jan 5-6 in DC.  He was arrested a week ago at his Newberg, NY tattoo parlor.
Awesome. Best wishes to him and his family.

Great info on FCC Part 95 acceptance for FRS, GMRS, MURS.  
FRS radios require Part 95E certification.
GMRS radios need Part 95E certification. 
MURS radios require Part 95J certification. 

Check on the back of the radio for the "FCC ID" sticker. This FCC ID can be looked up to see what rule parts the radio is certified for. An FCC ID label is required to be placed on the back of the radio.

For those new to radio, THREE things must be in place to legally transmit according to the FCC:
1)  LICENSE. you,the operator, MAY be required to hold an operator's license depending on the radio frequencies you use.
2)  CERTIFICATION.  The RADIO you are using must be certified by the FCC to transmit on the radio's intended frequencies.
3)  POWER. Your radio's power is rated in watts and may have several power settings. You MUST not exceed the FCC power (wattage) limits assigned to the frequencies, channels, bands, services you are transmitting on.
That makes so much sense.  They arrest him for not attending court when they would not let him attend court.
People wearing masks in America must end now. All they are, is way for the ruling class to divide us.
MF/HF ham radio (160 m to 10 m, and maybe even 6 m from time to time) -- long distance stuff
No discussion of illegal radio use will be allowed.
Wonder if he is wearing a mask in jail?
No discussion of illegal radio use allowed. 
This includes discussion of programming radios for frequencies they are not authorized to transmit on.
Discussion of MURS/FRS/GMRS and VHF/UHF ham radio resources
No discussion of illegal radio use allowed,
including of programming radios for frequencies they are not authorized to transmit on.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=RjMKc9PuMQFvAm9LA) Interesting question. My understanding is that they cannot physically force you to wear one anywhere. I would be interested to know if anyone else here has any information on that.
uv-5r info from one guy who it seems had bad luck with them
Well Biden, or his puppet master, has the power to require masks, and even double masks in all federal facilities, and he has done just that.  While it would be fun to challenge I have too much to do.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=rkXcGXfhTDm6t7pgu) I may be wrong, but while these "mandates" are being spouted by whomever, I really don't think they are enforceable (especially in an involuntary detention situation) if the person declares that they have a medical or religious reason for refusing. I would be interested to know if anyone here has any direct experience with the system to confirm or refute that. I am an ardent anti-masker, and I haven't been able to find any info on how this is being handled, except recently hear that in a County jail here in Colorado, it was totally voluntary for both staff and inmates (except you have to sign a waiver of liability if you choose not to wear one, which I believe is acceptable).

You should pass this on to any non-far left folks in your circle of friends.
Do you know it is insecure for folks to send you their ID via email?
It is more secure for them to attach files in a private chat to you, or if you can get them on signal to have them send the files via signal.
Hmmmm looks like file uploads are broken at the moment.  I will have a look at that later.

Good morning everyone. I was just wondering who our state leader was. I ask asking some questions in the general chat and was told that I need to go through vetting at the state level.
I‚Äôm new as well but everyone is nice and super helpful. If you just reach out to them and send a direct message they will get back to you. They are trying to rebuild this thing from the ground up so your credit card provider that you use could end up being a huge help.

If you are new to radio and feel a little overwhelmed navigating all the legal ins and outs of radio, you are not alone. It's a complicated subject, and the FCC hasn't made it very easy. 

If you are interested in local radio communication, this is the correct chat. The other comms chat for HF (high frequency bands) is geared for licensed ham operators who transmit on those particular bands. 

FCC rules and regs are complex. Post your questions here. Experienced operators will jump in to help you.

Good morning.  Nomad1776 suggested that I reach out to you regarding the credit card processing situation.  I have a small business and I use a veteran owned company called 2nd Amendment Processing to prevent deplatforming. They are known for servicing clients who want their 1st Amendment rights protected and they are good guys.
Not I. You might want to plug jpj with this though as he was key in restoring this site to the current platform.
TIME FOR ACTION!  end these days of poking holes in the air
ME, YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE
if the only response i get here amounts to nothing more than crickets -- i will shake the dust from my sandals and move on
Thanks -- checking now
i see more outrage expressed  as comments at the end of media articles that are posted in this chat room
crickets here
Just install the app and give it the url for the chat
why you posting using my handle?  who are you?
never mind - just noticed the name transposition
How about keeping your posts topical for the chat they are in.  Your mask burning post has no place in the comms channels.
That's funny 1patriot, I remember those days, but today is different, with internet, social media, fake news... You should have figured by now that when patriots protest to their masters, asking for permission, the media and politicians spread the word that it is domestic terrorism. I don't protest, burn things, and put on a show but, what I would do, is stand for our freedom, and sacrifice, to save our country. What should happen is all patriot leaders should get together, join forces, get the numbers that are not just internet worriers, and take a stand! If we had our own army of thousands, we then have a meeting with government, and let them know who is constitutionally  in charge of the country, if they don't conform, we take it back the hard way. The way things are going today, we are going to end up as gorillas in small groups, always in hiding (domestic terrorists). Last year, Virginia should have been the first state to take control of their government but, instead, they let their government perform unconstitutional acts and went home after they protested their masters. They had the armed numbers but were afraid to step out of the box, even with patriot support from around the country...go figure?
Damn I see you spammed most of the rooms.
That is not acceptable
is that so?  good to know.  i thought this was a channel was for patriots.  who's offended?  cowards?
Spamming the chats is not the way to get anything done and it is not acceptable.  You are welcome to engage your fellow members in the proper forum and try to get buy in for your ideas, but you are not welcome to post the same message in each and every room.
+  lol.  shall i post an apology to all those chat rooms now, herr commandant?  if this is just a site for gasbags, i guess i am in the wrong place.
Our vetting email is to Proton and that email is only used for vetting.  We know that sending and receiving to that address from a non-Proton mail is not secure.   Its just what we had to work with.  Our vetting procedure we use a paid for back ground check service and run them than review social media, criminal history and such.  Than we talk via phone or face to face. If they pass we make them get a Proton and from then on all official GOAK correspondence is done Proton to Proton.  We do not let them in our GAOK Signal until they pass the background and are invited in.  I will mention what you said to our vetting team. If its more secure to attach here than i can see us changing.   When we get the new member report up and running that will help as well.    In case i am asked how can i explain that attaching here in a DM is more secure?
Well at the moment you can not attach here in DM.  I just discovered that it is not working.  I am working on that now.
I saw.
When I get breathing room I will be doing a write up on basic info and data security for patriots.  Need to get the burning ducks put out first.
looks like it, so far.  what a bunch of wusses.  just want membership cards evidentally
I know,  you said once things settled down you would get to it.
Best bet is have them install signal on their phone and send you stuff via signal.
Quick, easy, secure
I am mentioning it to them now and will tell them once the attachment feature is worked out it will be a more secure option.
If they can not install signal then they are no use to us as we will use that for ops comms in future like in the past
I think that might be an issue because whoever it is will be able to see the cell number of the person they are DM'ing and since they are not vetted for GA it might be an issue
I think attaching as a DM in Rocket is a good idea
Well you could set up a burner cell for that, but you will be speaking on the phone with them anyway and they will have your cell then in any case.
Yeah I am trying to figure the RC thing out.
I think that is the best solution.
Me too, its direct and we have had to walk people through installing Signal in the past -if you can believe that
Good god, but they can install candy crush or twiddle-twiddle-time-waster
Ok let me get back to it.  No idea why the uploads are failing.
I know! But yes we have had to do it
Ok, i just DM'ed them.  Will let you know.  Thank you!!
Seems the file upload thing is a big rocket chat bug.  Loads of issues reported.  No fix noted yet.
Poo.....it would have streamlined things for our vetting
Is it something you can dig into the code and figure out?
ABOUT MURS, FRS, GMRS 2-way radios

MURS (Mult-Use Radio Service)  ***NO OPERATOR LICENSE REQ'D***  The radio itself must be FCC Part 95 "certified."  
+ Limited to 5 frequencies in the VHF band.
+ Transmit power limited to 2 watts or less.

FRS (Family Radio Service)  ***NO OPERATOR LICENSE REQ'D***  The radio itself must be FCC Part 95 "certified." 
+ 7 frequencies in UHF, limited to 0.5 watts power
+ 15 frequencies in UHF, limited to 2.0 watts power
+ The radio's antenna must be attached to radio, ie not removable
+ Many 2-way radios are FRS and GMRS capable. All 22 FRS frequencies are shared with GMRS frequencies. You may use any FRS frequency shared with GMRS frequencies without a GMRS license as long as you follow the FRS frequencies, power limits, and leave the radio's antenna unchanged. (Transmitting on FRS freqs or FRS/GMRS shared freqs ABOVE FRS power limits is illegal unless you have a GMRS operator license.)

GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service)  ***GMRS LICENSE IS REQUIRED***  Additionally, your radio must be FCC Part 95 "certified."
+ 7 frequencies in UHF band, limited to 0.5 watts transmit power
+ 7 frequencies in UHF band, limited to 5 watts
+ 16 frequencies in UHF band, limited to 50 watts
+ GMRS license cost is $35 and covers you and family members, good for 10 years. NO TEST, you need only apply for the license at FCC.

Links to FCC's allocation of MURS, FRS, and GMRS frequencies and power limits to be listed below.
Who was the person you removed from the Ga chat?
He was a fellow who spammed every group with the same message telling leadership to get off their lead asses.
Ok, i thought so. I read about it in the General chat
Yep he put that in the comms chat and pretty much every other chat.  Spoke to him in pm and wised off to me.  No one claimed him so he is kicked out for now
www.infowars.com.  SR is on now.
www.infowars.com - SR live now
Did he just co-op your name to post again?
Where do you see that?
two up from where you just posted in General?

4m
Nope.....SR asked me what he posted, so I posted it in the chat for SR.
BTW if you add me to your phone directory as JPJ then I will show up in the signal as JPJ
in Signal?
Yep......signal takes names from either your profile - I do not have one - your google address - or what is in the person's contacts on their phone.
Not sure how to do that. I use a PC.  It has limited capabilities
You have to have signal on your phone to get it on your PC.  But no worries.  Just trying to make it easier for you.  I use signal generally, not just for OK, and I suggest that to everyone.  That is why I do not have a profile pic or name that is specific to OK.  All my android devices have similar addresses associated.  All tekhqdroid## so I am not giving any information away to randoms that google may hand data to.
Yes, i do. I just rarely use it on my phone. I use android as well.  I find Apple hard to work with
So just pick up your android and save my number to your contacts with the name JPJ or John Paul Jones or JPJ NY what ever you feel like then I will show up as that in signal for you.
Oh i get it now
As Stewart was saying-  With things going to sh-t nationally our local communities, local schools, local churches must be the firewall which keeps the perverted and totalitarian Left out of our homes.
A few considerations before registering for a GMRS license...

After registering for a GMRS license, you will be issued a "call sign" by the FCC.  FCC call signs (eg WX5TBA) are easy to look up online on the FCC website. The address you list when registering for the license is available to the public. Yes, you can use a PO Box.
@Keeping.AZ that is why I strongly suggest FRS not GMRS.
Yes if you have a mobile or base GMRS at 25 or 50 watts you will get out further, but for most OK purposes comms are only needed out a few miles.  Even with the higher power of GMRS mobiles you will not get much over 5-10 miles mobile to mobile.
That would almost seem like an act of war to me...alot of those refugees are gonna be criminals or terrorist type mixed in as well....
CAUTION! 
Whether you are transmitting on non-licensed services (MURS, FRS, CB) or licensed services (GMRS, Ham), it is ILLEGAL to transmit coded messages, ciphers, or transmissions that obscure the true meaning of your message (with the exception of Morse Code). 

NO license is required to LISTEN to GMRS and ham radio frequencies. The license is only required if you want to TRANSMIT. The GMRS license is not the same as a ham license. There are 3 levels of ham licenses, each of which require passing written exams.

IMPORTANT consideration before licensing with the FCC. Once you are licensed, you are subject to FCC rules, regulations, privileges, AND FCC INSPECTION by FCC field agents. That means inspections of your radio equipment in your HOME, on demand, and without notice. More about inspections on the FCC website. Just sayin'. Look before you leap.  Listening to ham radio requires NO license, but if you want to really learn how to use that ham radio to communicate and help others, get a ham license.
Good FRS radio...

Includes:
+ FCC Part 95 certified
+ Scan feature (also FCC certified)
+ 14 FRS frequencies
+ Power limits 0.5 watts and 1.5 watts (radio automatically changes to 0.5 watts when using 0.5 watt FRS frequencies)
+ Uses AA regular or rechargable batteries (with usb charging port)
+ Weather proof
+ Headset/mic port
+ NOAA weather channels
+ Digital display

Good Afternoon from Port Charlotte
Even users of unlicensed services are subject to FCC regs.  Just the regs are different.
That Motorola listed above is the full 22 channels.  FCC expanded FRS to 22 channels and 2 watts last year I believe.
That will be a much better radio than the Baofeng FRS offerings.
If folks look around there are some IP68 floating FRS units I believe.
Thank God I live in Florida. No mandates, no masks, just freedom to be me. I do feel for others that are behind the iron curtain.
When it comes to FRS and GMRS radios keep in mind there are only 22 channels.  I am seeing some radios listed on amazon claiming 36 or 50 channels.  I have not investigated what is up with that you, but it could be they have some channels set up for GMRS repeaters.  That is fine if you own a GMRS repeater or know someone who does, but for general OK purposes for short range comms we only need simplex communications, so no need for the added expense of a repeater capable radio and no need to register with the FCC if we stick with FRS.
Try https://mypatriotsnetwork.com/groups/brunswick-county-nc-585775281/
Folks need to get their comms straight for their local area and possible events outside of OK purposes
Yes, but for OK purposes we will be operating in the law.
Of course.
Lowest common denominator for OK is FRS.  Not everyone wants to get a ham license, and many OK I know who just got it to use a vhf/uhf radio are not really capable of using their vhf/uhf handheld any better than they could use an FRS, meaning I had an 8 guy team where they were all licensed and none of them could come up on a repeater without someone else handing them the radio set to the right channel.
If someone has need of GMRS for their family or business comms they can of course use that to interoperate with any OK using FRS, but some folks do not need a GMRS base station, Mobile Station, and do not have access to a GMRS repeater or the ability to build one, but you are right if anyone is working with other local emergency groups you need to figure out what you need to work with them.
Most places I have lived outside of NYC the local emergency services used hams when the emergency services comms were out or overloaded
AZ  doesn't have a mask mandate either but hasn't been as open as FL
I thought folks ran all over AZ wearing bandannas pulled up and robbing stage coaches?
I used ICOMS on border ops.   We had a repeater we set up in our AO.  We used FRS to listen to smugglers because that's what they used.  Quality of audio always let us know how far away they were.  Like belling cats.  LOL
Keep in Mind, this is one of the most active smuggling routes in AZ.  Cartels control this area. CBP Expands Simplified Arrival in Arizona https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-expands-simplified-arrival-arizona via @cbp

jpj  we do  lol
Yes indeed, it seems that people lie, cheat and steal. Some one needs to stand up to the Bureaucratic bastards and lead a massive group.
Ham or GMRS or Part 90 Icoms?  Icom makes many kinds of radios.
@FN9 does that mean the cartels are getting the welcome wagon?  I am not sure of folks realize this, but someone here illegally can get a green card pretty quick if they get married.  I think it is a loophole we need to plug, but the pretender-N-chief is not interested in plugging anything.  He prefers to captain a sinking ship.....hell he is drilling more holes.
Sorry, figuring out who you are lol.  The one guy with the name like yours was booted.
Yeah he spammed every channel, then when I told him that was not acceptable he had a few choice words about me.  I have a thick skin, but you do not start off mouthing off when you are being told nicely you made a mistake please do not do it again.
@wdwolf @decius great to have you!  We are going to be calling on folks to help.  At the moment we are both recovering from the deplatforming and the fall out from some folks not thinking on Jan 6.  One thing that NEEDS to happen is to recruit folks you know to write our useless senators to oppose HR1 when it hits the senate.  I know it is not likely that Chuck and Gilibrand will listen, but it may be if they get enough letters they may think twice about either passing it or busting the filibuster.  Chuck wants to bust the filibuster so we are a perm one party system.
Those are HR1 talking points.  Pass that around to anyone you know who is not FAR left.  Get them to stand up and be heard as well.  Like our forefathers in the 1770s we must use all our tools, and that includes public pressure on our public servants.
JPJ  it means Biden's DHS just oiled the turnstile.
Lukeville area is on Tohono O reservation and completely controlled by cartels with assistance of much of the tribe.  They smuggle drugs through this area and smuggle people through Yuma area.
This is area where cartel smugglers shot & killed BP Agt Brian Terry.  He was killed just north of there
anyone have a link to SR interview on infowars?
Today, I cant find it
I know your busy but can you go into the WA channel and give me your opinion on TheGman's last post. Is this incitement or just spouting off
What‚Äôs up Tennessee? Bought property there and changing residence from Virginia. 
Banned.video has the interview
On it.
Sucknunu is supposed to be making a "ruling" on Masks.  This POS needs to find his ass in a fema camp.
All Nevadans ,  go to the state legislature site and oppose AB286.  This bill shreds the 2nd amendment more.  Out laws home built guns and disallows guns in any public building even with a CCW.   They want us to be sitting ducks in their ‚Äúgun free zones‚Äù .  They have closed OUR legislative building off to us so they can gather around their cauldron and shove their bullshit bills down our throats behind closed doors.

Good Afternoon from Central Texas

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/CO?msg=xmTg7a7tfjxSWCpC3) Love it! Yes, we must be the new radicals (for freedom and liberty) now. Own it and rock it like the Anti-American feminists did. Maybe we can still shake some sense with them that way. The only thing that's going to end this tragedy, short of force, will be just most of the people refusing to comply with any of the mandates or restrictions. If we all just say no, then we win. How is that for "radical" thinking?
LOL no madmarine4212 you can find AZ folks in #AZ

Hello - I am in Texas
Great!  Thanks!  We need to 'cross educate each other
I am on a quest don't let me scare you off. lol
Hi. I see your quest to solve the crime of the century. Lol good luck to you.
Great to see you here molly!  I think we have enough skilled researchers here to help
Hello Wisconsinites.
@grayghost39 did you get one or 2 emails about the account activation?  Did one of them have your temp password?
If you are interested in getting educated in radio your best bet is to find a ham radio club local to you.
@mollypitcher If you go back through the twitter timeline of @donk_enby (she's the one who originally scraped Parler), I believe I remember seeing an interactive map with markers that linked to the geolocation metadata of specific videos in a database that accompanied the map. If not there, you could also look back on the feed of one John Scott-Railton @jsrailton who is a Canadian independent investigative reporter who continues to act as go-between between the larger Antifa crowd-sourcing gang, the major news outlets and the FBI all in an effort to identify every last patriot possible that was present in DC on the 6th. Good luck.
Hams tend to be a friendly bunch, except me.  I don't like anyone.
I have been sorting through that - they issue I am having is I have seen videos elsewhere that aren't on theirs -ugh
I have a vested interest, I love and respect the guys who got sucked in.
Southern border (mexico)is hot tonight folks..anybody else gettin comms on that ?
Molly..I do not remember what feed it was
Mbut i watched..the dc police open the doors and ket em in...
Also saw girl take that hit in the neck
I passed a link earlier that showed the girl getting shot.
Everyone that uses signal needs to look at this page: http://www.oathkeepers.nyc/resources/comms/secure/signal-hijack-attempt.xhtml
and everyone should be using signal
Looks like Baofeng got legal for GMRS https://www.baofengradio.com/products/uv-5x  but keep in mind these radios will ONLY transmit on GMRS/FRS channels.  At least that is what the data sheet says and that is what is required to be a legal GMRS radio.  I do not have a spare $60 lying about to see if this can also be programed for other freqs if you hit it with chirp.  If someone wants to send me a radio I will be happy to see what else it can do and report back.  They are still not good for an urban environment though.  Not good in high RF areas.
...straight talk, in everyday language.
And the short answer is NO.
The idiot fuck is moving us to war with the two most powerful nations in the world and we now have a second rate navy and in general a third rate military more worried about being PC than terminating the enemy.
Good morning all. Check in from NC. Tough long day yesterday be safe all!
So the way forward looks like getting a GMRS license to be able to use FRS and GMRS and long term amateur license. Great video very helpful! Thanks AZ
Good morning from Texas
I wanted to reach out to you about the deplatforming. I have a small business and I use a company called 2nd Amendment Processing for credit card payments. They are veteran owned and pro-Constitution. I would look at them to get credit card processing back online. Just trying to help out.
Good morning!
If you havnt yet, go to the top, click the globe which is our directory and find your state and introduce yourself
Morning, not many Texans showing up on here?
@DaveyE7 , you're welcome!

The following might be helpful those of us new to comms or do not have the time, money, or interest to invest in comms...
1)  Buy a battery operated AM/FM radio, with Shortwave bands if can afford it. (I like to keep all my devices on ONE battery type, AA)
2)  Buy a pack of new batteries
3)  Buy a battery tester 
4)  Buy a pack of rechargeable batteries
5)  Buy a solar powered battery charger 
6)  Buy a set of ear buds/headphones for your radio

NOW you can get into 2-way radios...
1)  FRS RADIO. Buy at least 2 (one pair) FRS-dedicated, 2-way radios. FCC licensed, non-removable antenna, pre-programed for 22 FRS channels, ie frequencies, power rating 0.5 watts up to 2.0 watts, with port for earpiece/mic, and uses the same batteries that you use for your other devices.  Yes, they look like goofy toys, but they're legal and easy to use.  AND you can't roll with OKers, without one. (NOTE: most FRS dedicated 2-way radios are also GMRS capable. That's fine. Just use the FRS channels at power settings for FRS use. Many FRS radios will automatically reduce power output to FRS limits to keep you legal.)
2)  Buy an connecting earpiece/mic (like the FBI uses) compatible with your FRS radio
3)  Buy a durable pouch for your FRS radio that allows you to attach/strap/velcro/molle to your chest rig, backpack straps, or belt (best to strap the radio near your shoulder for better reception/transmit).
4)  Make extra copies of your radio's instruction manual, and keep with each radio (because you'll forget how to use it when it comes time).

AFTER the above is squared away, you can move on to scanners, CB/MURS, GMRS/GMRS license, Ham radio listening, Ham transmitting/Ham license. 

REMEMBER: You don't need an FCC license to LISTEN.
Good morning Patriots!

Lord please bring freedom to   the oppressed and justice to the evil ones. Let those who attack your children be caught in their own trap and fail in all their attempts to persecute and harm your Christian children. We know it is Your will to bring the gospel, the good word of our Savior Jesus Christ to all who will open their hearts to you. Give us strength to do Your good works.

Thanks so much.  Someone already passed them on to me and I turned the info over to the person that deals with our member payments.  He is working with 2A to try and get us going!
Please note combo FRS/GMRS radios are no longer available and can not be legally made.  The same FCC rule change that upped FRS to 2 watts made the combo radios illegal.  Radios already owned that are less than 2 watts are now considered FRS if they do not have GMRS repeater channels.  If they have GMRS repeater channels they are GMRS and require a license.

Earpiece in a radio is essential. I used an earpiece when I was security at one of the large hospitals in downtown Charlotte. Could keep the volume down to an acceptable level and not bother anyone and kept your hands free to deal with the idiots. Plus no one heard you coming along with all the on air traffic blaring off your belt. 
Bought some Uniden FRS 22 channel radios a few years ago for the family. Work well, just need to get earphones for them. They are rechargeable which I like also
Best are units with rechargeable batteries that can also take AA or AAA alk primary cells in case you have a long use time with no ability for downtime to charge.  I have to update my FRS.  I have 4 14 channel units from when FRS first came into being.  I am at the moment researching FRS, but just like TVs these days the makers publish no useful specs most of the time.  Power out is only one of many things to consider.
I have yet to see intermod or adjacent channel rejection, or even sensitivity figures on most of them.
Forget about anything having to do with front end overload.
I was looking at these possibly
Those are NOT FRS.
Those are either not legal in the US except for Ham use or they are commercial Part 90 radios only legal for Ham and Part 90.  That of course assumes they are field programable to something other than their 16 pre-programed freqs.
Much radio stuff sold on the net is not actually legal, or not legal without a license.
Interesting because when I searched FRS radios that came up.
Off the table now
That just means whoever put up the ADVERT tweaked the terms to come up in an FRS search
Try to stick to known companies advertising overtly as FRS.
Of course
Will do
Motorola, Cobra, Uniden, Icom
I am actually probably going to go with some waterproof floating units as mine may find themselves on boats from time to time.
A good clue the radio is NOT FRS is when they give a wide range of frequencies.  FRS are 22 specific freqs in the 460Mhz range.
I am pretty sure DeWalt is also selling legal FRS for use on construction sites now.
I think I saw them at Lowes or Home Depot
Also the so-called 36 channel units are GMRS.  Perfectly fine and will interop with FRS, but require FCC license
The so-called extra channels are just the repeater inputs for GMRS repeaters
If going GMRS get a radio that can do repeaters on the off chance somehow a friendly repeater appears in the AO.
One clue...if the specs show a SMA (male of female) antenna connector, it is NOT FRS, FRS cannot change antennas.
If the specs show ANY removable antenna it is not FRS.  No matter the connector.  Good point Rev-Mike.
Yeah, but most of the FRS are chinna products and almost all use the Baofeng SMA-female antenna connection.  I over specified, instead of generalized.  FRS=NO antenna change; GMRS=allowed antenna change.
Actually NONE of the FRS are as you describe.  By defination if they are not type approved as FRS with a type approval they are not FRS radios.  They may be UHF walkie talkies, and if they can be programed to the UHF ham band they are legal for hams to use, but never for FRS
So pretty much the China products are useless for anything but Ham unless they have a Part 90 fcc sticker, in which case they are good for Part 90 land mobile and ham both.
But as a ham understanding the need for agility at times I would not have a Ham rig I could not field program without anything more than my fingers.
Good afternoon!
Yeah, again, but almost ALL radios are manufactured in chinna, rare (much more expensive brands) are made in Taiwan, (rarely) Japan or S Korea.  BUT, again, they are more expensive.  I think the Dewalt are cninna products, too.
A good explanation and examples can be fond on YouTube...HAM Crash Course.  LOTS of FRS, GMRS, and, of course, HAM.
Again, some of the more $$ FRS, for some of us on *very* restricted income.
That is a promising FRS radio.  They do not specify power, but they do say in the spec sheet it is FRS.  That seems to be the top of the line in the talkabout product set from Motorola, so I suspect any motorola talkabout will be an FRS legal radio.
The talkabout line.
rev-mike I understand about income limits.  One thing to remember is that a radio can save your life, so one should go for the best one can afford just like body armor or firearms or ammo.  Most of the really cheap off brand and Baofeng (yep they came out with a legal GMRS at last) have crap receivers that do not work in urban locals.  You may say I do not live in an urban local, but one never knows what may happen and you may have to operate in DC, NY, Chi, LA, Boston, PGH.....I think you get my drift.
Most bubble pack FRS radios from Cobra, Uniden, Motorola are affordable and legal FRS units that will preform much better than the china illegal or marginally legal shit on ebay and amazon.
Oh I forgot to mention Audiovox as a good maker too.  My first 2 14 channel 1/2 watt units are audiovox and they have been great for more than 20 years
They RX much better than my UV-5r
I understand, but the example you posted comes up per pair: "$109.99  Backordered"  and their range!!!!  Optimistic at best "35 miles (voice); 25 miles (data)"!!
rev-mike I said that was the TOP OF THE LINE for motorola talkabout and they were listed as FRS, which leads me to believe the lower price point units in that line are also FRS.  I did not take the time to look at the spec sheet for each unit in their line.
Range figures are bullshit on all these radios.  Not going into a lesson on radio propagation, but under normal circumstances expect no more than 2-5 miles in open country and max 2 miles urban, more like 1 mile.
It also depends on the rx sensitivity of the radio you are talking to and of course his tx power
Got it thanks revmike
Oh, I know that...they are all optimistic lies.  The 35mi that they list is further explained as "from mountain top to valley" in PERFECT conditions.  Again, basic unobstructed line of sight.
Cheaper alternative for the 'poor folks' is https://shop.motorolasolutions.com/t110tp-alkaline-two-way-radios-triple-pack/product/T1B02201MATAAW3  $49 for 3, alkaline powered (up to 19 hours), NO waterproof/resistance listing.  The top of the line acts like a HAM APRES radio, with location tracking and GPS (not something I think that would be wanted on opps).
Just went online and applied for my GMRS license. Simple enough process. The info in this thread has been very helpful. Thanks all
Yes GMRS is simple to get.  Some of us do not want to be on Gov Radar.
If you are not going to use more than 2 watts and not going to use repeaters it is not needed.
LOL they pay me every month as thanks for busting my behind for them sooooo it already too late for me
If you did get a GMRS license then you want to buy repeater capable radios.
Different radar Dave
Yes that‚Äôs why I did it and I know
You may also want to buy a high power mobile or base unit with appropriate antenna.
That‚Äôs also in the plan as well
High Power Mobile GMRS can be good to have on an OP.  Even if he can not hear all the portables they may hear a retreat, recall, or change of plan message from him.
Thats true
Sadly on many urban OPS no place to park a mobile.
Yes you are right about that. Checked out my radios per AZ‚Äôs advice above they do work on regular batteries as well the rechargeables
Those Motorola‚Äôs look good, the ones you posted jpj
Yep the motorola's are good.  The top end ones with position exchange and bluetooth to cell phone could have some interesting applications, but one has to be careful how to use such features lest they be used to pinpoint one if the signals are being intercepted.  Not that RDF takes much more than a few minutes at UHF with modern tech, but I am thinking later, like they FBI is using cellphones to track folks that were in DC Jan 5/6.
I could though see the application for sending files bluetooth Tablet -> Radio -> Radio -> Tablet
I had the same thoughts on Bluetoothing to your cellphone, but yes some features it could be handy to have
1patriot I can agree with that ,we're trying to figure out who the leadership is and at this point I still don't know. I suggest 7-8pm chat time.
Hi all
:star2: Honor the Texas flag; I pledge allegiance to thee, Texas, one state under God, one and indivisible. :cowboy:
Minimum for OK OPS should be a reliable major brand 22 channel 2 watt FRS.
The bigger the antenna the better

There is a bug in rocket chat that is preventing upload of files.  Once I get the issue sorted I will upload some resources.

LOL stop and nag!  Have not seen that happen yet, but perhaps I will.  I do not wear a mask until I go inside someplace that requires it.
Me no mask ever
Fuck em
That's That's nice thing about having a mobile with crossband repeat capabilities. Find a nice parking garage or other elevated position, and boom, mobile repeater.
Whole family..no mask ever...not even a sniffle all year...
Strong appalachian immune system
No such thing as cross band repeat except in the Amateur service.
But if there is no place to park a mobile there is no place to park a mobile that has cross band repeat capability.
Correct on the Ham lisense requirement, but regardless it's a nice capability to have at your fingertips. I don't see it mentioned much.
Mostly useless for most comms for any OK ops.  I doubt we will get that many OK licensed and profecient.  I spent a year trying to get 8 guys in NY clueful about radio.  Even after they got their tickets since they really had no interest in radio  they could not even use their radios on their own.
Besides that, there is also the option of setting up a "mobile" rig in an elevated position, such as a hotel room.
Yes, or even just a hand held at an overlooking position.
I was still talking about xband repeat
Well we need to think of what is practical.  Getting folks licensed and capable of using their radios is a huge effort.  I know.  I have done the drill.
Thats what RTO's are for :-D
I had guys that would drive every weekend from NYC to PA to shoot and train with weapons, but not one would practice with radio.
Folks have to have an interest
I'm looking at picking up one of the newish Kerbos SDR's to monkey with RDF in a practical sense. Could come in handy at some point to have hands on experience 
In NYC you can not enter some businesses without a mask.  If you do the business owner can lose his license and face big fines.  Of course a business has the right to say who walks through their doors.
I survived living through the poo pond overflowing and flooding our tent at KAF.
I would not doubt that the masks are a way to indirectly from behind a hidden agenda a controlled angle ad approach to have the ability to control ones speech. A lot of psychology goes into control of the mind a little at a time.
We all touch the same gas pumps, wal-mart doors, service station doors, restroom doors, I see mask as a form of control and the virus as a flu blown out of proportion for control from people who can't get approval so their only option is force.  Most people are easily scared. I can tell a bull shooter and a con a mile away.
NEW YORK CITY......git a rope!
Morning all be careful out there!
Good morning again!
Good morning. I appreciate the information in here it has been very helpful. Thanks again, comms are important but agree we need to keep it simple for a lot of reasons

Ok great.  I use them for my business and the are both professional and reliable.
Also, how do new members get vetted into the other chats?  I am in Texas and was under the impression that Oathkeepers national leadership is in Texas (or at least some of them are). Is there someone specific here that I should be reaching out to?
I'm in Wise County. North DFW area.
Morning, How many of us are in the Temple/Waco/Killeen area?  Or close enough to that area to possibly meet up and get acquainted?

Hello jpj and my fellow members,
Good morning USA!
I have not yet gotten my technicians license but I'm planning on it soon. I
Sadly I just found out last night there are no part 95 accepted repeaters available and the recent FCC rule changes means that one can no longer use Part 90 equipment for GMRS so the FCC is making GMRS into a short range simplex ghetto.
A national GMRS group is trying to get the FCC to change the rules back to allow part 90 equipment again.
So pretty tough to put up a new GMRS repeater and also damn near impossible to repair an old one.
Also MANY GMRS radios that are legal under the new rules do not have the repeater inputs.
We had a bunch of folks bail in state leadership recently.  National is vetting new state leaders who will vet folks in their state.
Join the #TX  channel and get to know folks there as a starting point.
It may take a while we are dealing with lots of shit, deplatforming, no CC processing, lawsuit and more
Does anyone know if we have a HAM/OCs group in the Boston area? I haven't received any reach back from anyone in MA or the surrounding states, ie. NH. or PA. I can imagine there is a bit of paranoia with the Jan6th stuff, but I would like to get involved and learn HAM & CW and learn some survival, trapping, skinning, processing and such.
@ssgtgman if you want to get your ham license, which I think is a good thing, your best bet is to start at www.arrl.org.
They have resources there.  There are many study guides and also many online study resources including videos.
While there are some programs that teach you by having you memorize all the questions and the right answers I do not feel that is the best way.
To be effective at comms you have to understand the material.  To that end use resources that explain the theory.
Will do. I have some equipment I just need to put the time in and get licensed.
There are also ham radio clubs in Boston and the surrounding areas.
You can probably find info on some of them from www.arrl.org.
Also a google of ham radio club boston may turn something up.
I'll check that out. I picked up a Kenwood TS-2000 and a couple of Baofeng uv-5rtp units a while back must get studying
I can't find were I log out of the chat? When I opened it today it just opened no sign in. I'm missing something?
uv-5r is no good in urban locals.
Your initial upper left.  Pull down menu.
That is an early sign of demtia
I had to tap on my letter designation top left. Thank you
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/Comms_Radio_VHF_UHF?msg=9ux5Dodd5zaEdfsPi) Welcome, @ssgtgman! 
Kenwood TS-2000? Dannnnnngggggggg! Nice rig.
Keep the Baofengs for SHTF, but until then, invest in a cheap pair of FRS dedicated handtalkies to stay legal for local OK ops/events. Scroll above for FRS radio info. Even if you never use the FRS for OK events, you'll have them for family outings, car caravans, camping, hiking, hunting, amusement parks, the zoo, car shows, etc. DO NOT put your ham license at risk of being revoked and that TS-2000 at risk of confiscation by FCC. 

Stay legal: stay useful!
Signal sounds like a good idea use, at first look, and I know OK has used it in the past.  However, it is an open source app whose codebase is publicly known and available.  Depending on the amount of "hardening" done the Dev, the app could be easily compromised.  Further, this goes with any app, but be wary of any app that lists In-Q-Tel as an investor.  In-Q-tel is a public/private arm of the CIA that is used to invest in emerging technologies.  I haven't been able to locate info on Signal's investors personally; but if you locate any, I would look to see if In-Q-tel is listed.  In-Q-Tel, officially, considers itself separate from the CIA, but has extremely close ties to the CIA and other intel agencies while investing taxpayer funds.

@jpj    I see Wiki's OK page is semi-locked. Wiki says I have to wait 4 days and edit 10 articles BEFORE I'm eligible to edit "semi-locked" articles like OKer's.  I edited 2 unrelated articles on Wiki this morning. Eight to go! 

I couldn't figure out a way to "add a section" as you say, on Wiki's OK page.  If you know how, let me know. Thx.
jpj, let's exchange contact info---before we get deplat'd again. You up for that? Is there a secure means of exchanging that info?
Been a while since I edited a wiki page, but once you get into the edit as I recall it is easy to find.  I need to set up my burner and start editing.
Yeah, it's got an html feel to it.
Actually being free software does not make it easy to compromise.  The crypto is pure math.  Being free software means folks can examine it for back doors.  It has been examined many times.
Now if someone downloads a non-signed version from an unknown source rather than the official version all bets are off, but that is true of anything.
Info on the UV5R
The "new" baofeng GMRS radio is just a UV-5r all locked up so they can meet the FCC rules and will have the same issues.
Also HamRadioPrep.  https://hamradioprep.com/.   Cost is now $49 for combo Technician/General License (worth the price, but I got it last autumn free, don't remember how, but...).  Guaranteed passing or $ back.
Or several other ailments, or just clumsiness.
Yup this was starting as I was retiring back in ‚Äò09. For Officers it was always politics but not to the extent he described. For SNCO/PO‚Äôs it was always about leadership and keeping your troops trained, ready and taken cared of, including kicking their butts if needed. Lord help us...
Incompetence? Is this a sign of that? It‚Äôs elder abuse...
Do you have gpg installed for use with your email?
I never said it would be easy, just that it could be vulnerable depending on the amount of "hardening" that has been done.  This is something my team of System Admins supporting one of my org's enterprise applications have to constantly worry about on the cybersecurity front with our open source software such as Apache Tomcat.  Just something to keep in mind with any app.

Good afternoon Patriots in Sunshine State!!!!
good afternoon!
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=bAWTvsf5T3NHP3uSq) Maybe those states will make the cut......next year
Keeping.AZ Thanks. I am studying and see that ARRL is offering license tests online now do to the vid. So setting up my notes in logical groups and with quick access tabs I should be a go soon. I also have an old Cobra 2000GTL. It's had some work done to it and supposedly covers a wide range of frequencies. But as you point out "keeping legal" saving it for SHTF or it may be useful as a reciever for additional monitoring while on the Kenwood. I will check out the FRS handhelds. But on the subject of handhelds, do you know if there are any that cover all of the bases, ie. FRS, and full HAM modes? I would like to find one that will also work on AM for CW.
I'm on the edge of Bell & McLennan Counties and it's not that far out for me.  Haven't heard of anything up in Waco area so I just as well go that way.
New FCC rules prohibit FRS or GMRS radios being able to operate anyplace else.
You have to have multiple radios.
I see
AM is hardly used in ham radio.  Some of us run AM on some of our old vintage gear, but below 50Myz voice is generally SSB.
Even older units that may be grandfathered?
Above 50 Mhz voice is generally FM
There are really no units that are "grandfathered".
Baofeng that were part 90 accepted before they lost their cert were good on GMRS, but never FRS.
Get some good quality FRS units for OK short range ops.
For ham use on vhf/uhf get a good quality HT from a good maker like Icom, Alinco, Yaesu or Kenwood.
Beyond that if you can afford it get a good quality mobile vhf/uhf ham rig properly installed in your car if you live someplace where it will not break the car window and escape.
I wouldn't know if any handhelds were ever made that cover both. But with new tech it's probably a lot easier to just have multiple units like you said. Plus some vintage things can be over priced.
I need about a week without interuption to put together a radio primer for OK
That's funny, where it won't escape!
I live in NYC.  Stuff added to the car tends to escape.
My two youngest live there. Not so good anymore!
Sounds like you've got a good plan in the works.  BUT we'll stay cocky until you knock us out of #1  LOL
What do you mean by radio primer?
Have not looked at that, but lots of bad info out on the net.  But yes a primer is an intro to a subject.
But for OK it needs to be a radio primer, not a ham radio primer.
Right, FRS so to keep it simple?
Well for useful legal radio comms for OK operations like PSD or general relief operations everyone needs a good working FRS.
Have you looked I to SDR (Software Defined Radio) ?
That is an apples and oranges thing
You can not just put any device that will produce a signal on FRS/GMRS channels
There is a tech guru I like on on Odysee Rob Braxman. He shares some interesting ideas
The Steering Committee is meeting on April 9th.  I will Direct Message you with status, and then we can speak, if you are interested. Hog :cowboy:
Good Evening!!!
Hello! hope you're doing well.
I am, how bout yourself.
Doing quite well, I'm especially happy to be in comms with my fellow patriots after all this time.
I joined up only about a day after everything was taken down, which I was quite unhappy to find out about!
Agreed, I'm also happy to be able to talk to y'all!
Mind if I ask about how long you've been a member?
Maybe a Month or two. Took me awhile to set the money aside.
Any knowledge I can gain from those who are more experienced will be a great help, as I said I joined up and got a membership right after the incident in DC.
During that time I had no comms with any members, today is my first time being able to speak with anyone.
Its honestly hard for me to pop in between work and other things, been working on that though! 
I went ahead and picked up a ton of gear for myself recently. most important of which being some plates, and a IFAK.
though, I was unable to get patches to identify myself due to the shop apparently being closed down...
I really need to get some gear. 
Well I'm more then happy to offer any help however I can if you need anything.
I spend a lot of time researching those sorts of things!
I was just going to go pick up a tan MOLLE, an IFAK, and a few other things. Might buy a new rifle first though. 
my suggestion would be that if you already have a long arm, you should go with the IFAK.
My current rifle is an aging 7mm bolt action, I need something a little more modern. Thinking about a MR223
My biggest suggestion is to worry more about the rest of your gear first, a nice fancy gun goes a long way! but you're only as good as your worst piece of kit, same goes for training.
True that
If you don't have plates or a decent helmet, get those. get an ifak, get your identification set up, those are extremely important. being able to identify who's with you and who's not is vital
as much as i'd like to spend everything ive got on the highest quality firearms, i won't have enough for anything else that way, consider radios, survival gear, rations, etc
You can't rely on others especially for that medical equipment. take a moment to evaluate yourself, look at everything you have and decide how long you could really make it out there if you couldn't go down to publix and grab yourself a nice meal to cook up for dinner
if you are set in that regard, you're safety and ability to survive on your own (at least for 2 months) is satisfactory, then it's a good time to worry about picking up a new long arm
I've got a large stockpile of survival gear (radios, flares, etc) , enough MRE's to last about a year and enough ammo made to last about 3 months or so. Next on my list is an IFAK followed up with the MOLLE and the plates. 
Don't forget your hard hat!
but i'm glad to hear you've taken that into account, it's such a shame that folks fail to consider the rest of their problems, one of my pals a while back when out and purchased an LWRC and then didn't have enough money to buy a pmag for it...
a higher end AR
he could have bought a PSA AR and gotten the rest of his kit with that kind of cash... might as well be carrying a overpriced bat
Got any suggestions on helmets?  I have good level IIIA armor.  Probably should get additional plates to bring it to level IV, but do not have a helmet.
any helmet that will accept an uparmoring plate
Ok being a Navy guy who only ever had the old style metal helmets on ship that means nothing to me.
the only helmet you're going to buy off the shelf that might even stop a decently sized round is a really heavy one
it's my personal goal to help guide all my brothers and sisters so that they remain as safe as possible, and are able to make the best decisions.
Well same company that made my body armor makes level IIIA baseball caps LOL
well, certainly a safe way to go to a game!
Seriously some links to helmets worth considering would be appreciated.  Last PSD I did for OK about 3 years ago I used my bicycle helmet.
Put an OK sticker on it.
do you want a link to the one i bought?
they're shipping really quickly.
Is it something that will protect my head if it comes down to a ruckus?
it sure is, but it'll put a little hole in your wallet i'm sad to say
i spent about 800 total on it
but thats for everything not including comtacs
I am poor, but at least it will let me see what I need.
800 will get you the helmet, and an up armoring plate
comtac headphones are great for shooters, they only block audio past 30db
so you and me could have a conversation, get into a scuffle and go back to talking
I use old muffs I have had since a kid when I shoot
Damn that sounds great
just remember that you won't be able to communicate with your buddies under fire
not including hand signals, i'd suggest learning them if you cant afford comtacs or similar
comtacs go around 400$
here you go https://www.hardheadveterans.com/products/ballistic-helmet
for this sort of gear, from ops core or similar you'd be paying 1000+ this is honestly a good deal
if there's anything else I can provide you please don't hesitate to ask me
This is good.  I know what I have to work to.
Wish I had a job.
it takes time. just remember that if something does go down, i'm willing to part with any spare gear for my brothers and sisters
Yeah but I am in NY.......Just in here because as an admin I really need to check in on things in each active room from time to time.
Ohhh, well thats a shame. i'm sorry for you, my family comes from there but from what i hear its gone rotten
Very rotten.  If I could get out I would.  Circumstances keep me hear at the moment.
you'll be in my prayers
I am the NYC restance.
jpj, how long have you been a member?
is there anything you can tell me, as a new member?
I have been a member since I think 2013.  What I can tell you is we basically are all volunteer and resources are thin.
I can say Stewart has a strict Keep It Legal policy.
Well i'm happy to hear about that
There are very few members in NYC!
The press bad mouths us
I was expecting to see a few more faces here, in all honesty
Yep... But you don't got to worry about me believing that horse shit haha
Stewart thinks we all need to read the founders and learn from them to defeat the domestic enemies
The press has been bad mouthing us everywhere
who cares, we have eachother.
True that! 
that's what is important.
the patriots around you are your family
The DOD has branded us as an org for active duty to steer clear of.
race, religion, it doesn't matter. we stand for the same thing
Saw a leaked photo from a recent training session
then maybe its good for us as people to speak out, and tell others as much as we can
That is what I try to do, but being in NYC I have to be careful.
jesus faced many difficulties trying to speak to people, we walk in those same steps
I mostly tell friends that are real close or folks I know in other parts of the country that are not full on libtard
it hurts me to think about it, but you have to know who is able to be helped and who isn't.
it was brother on brother then, and it will be the same way now
I do not even talk about anything to those with LDS (liberal Derangment Syndrom)
Much understandably
All I know is that I can be here for those around me who have found their way out.
you can lead, but you cannot force
the lord has a path for everyone, and everything is already decided. together we will be strong regardless of silly indifferences, the only way we will ever succeed is to put aside those differences for the greater good of Americans everywhere
I'm willing to do all I can for all of you, and I promise that mindset won't be changing now, or ever.
how are my fellow patriots doing this evening?
Even if NC pushes it thru the house and senate the governor won‚Äôt sign it. He can‚Äôt even reopen the schools here
Doing well viper hope you are
I sure am! Happy to be here, can't help but feel complete to be around fellow patriots.
Outstanding! Did you find your state thread?
I did indeed
I saw we were being told to email to get placed in the chapter, so thats what I did
Haven't gotten much of a response, but I hope to hear soon.
Great welcome! If that‚Äôs your state chapter each one does things differently. What state are you in?
Good evening
FL, the sunshine state.
Not too far from here in NC
oh wow! not bad!
I did expect to see more folks, but what can I really expect? it's only been back up for a little while haha
Yeah it can be depends on the time of night what everyone is doing etc
Hopefully you can hook up with local OK folks and get prepared with them and start vetting each other, get organized etc
Guess I got a bit ahead of myself! Oh yeah of course, but as I said I feel like I'm where I belong now. I browsed and looked through every group in my area and surrounding states, and selected OK as my new family, as I firmly believe in supporting the cause. I was just about set not including a place to call home, so here I am.
Glad to have you on board, be safe down there in FL
Doing my best, I think we're still on land.. but as we all know that water is rising. both physically and metaphorically!
Agreed it is
But, that is why we have eachother.
:smile: :thumbsup:
Good night all stay ready!
Good night!
@ssgtgman , take @jpj advice. I'm new to ham. Jpj knows WAY more than me. 

Jpj is right. In this day and age, you have to buy multiple radios for specific uses. FRS for example.  FRS two ways are often sold with GMRS capability, but so long as the radio power max transmits no more than FRS wattage, has a non-removable antenna, is FCC Part 95 certified, and you play nice, you're legal.  You can get a good pair for $50-$75. 

Regarding ham handhelds, there are a TON of great "duel band" radios out there---duel band usually means VHF and UHF.  Look for ones that have additional receive frequencies outside the transmit frequencies. And no, there are no FCC certified ham handheld radios that transmit in the FRS/GMRS frequencies. Again, you must buy separate radios for those freqs.  Seems like the FCC rules work in favor of radio companies, rather than consumers, eh?  That's what I was thinking.
I don't even know what that is.
Hi KAZ,
Same here.
I try to lead by example.  I have been doing lots of history and constitution education.
that's pretty dang impressive!
I've been looking into all of the new info you've all been sharing. If I'm not mistaken gmrs radios cover the frs bands just have to buy the 10 year license wich is going down to $35 from $70.
FRS and GMRS have 22 channels they share.  FRS and GMRS are allowed to talk to each other. Max power for FRS is 2 watts.  Some channels max power for both FRS and GMRS is 1/2 watt.  Max power on GMRS is 50 watts.  GMRS are also allowed to use repeaters, but there are no legal to buy GMRS repeaters these days.
How about Gpg4win - the Windows Version?
They offer this in a gmrs and an frs only model.    https://www.buytwowayradios.com/wouxun-kg-805g.html
For local comms for most OK operations the FRS power levels are fine and let's say you have a 50 watt GMRS in a car an FRS may hear it without being able to reach it.  So for most OK purposes FRS is good and you do not get on the Gove radar for having radio equipment.  Also do not need to give a call sign.  Call signs are in a public database.  Some ANTIFA shithead copies down your call sign they may then show up on your door step later.
I would want to see real tech specs on that radio.  Many of the chinese radios are SDR with no front end filtering on the RX.
Makes them crap in a city.
Motorola/uniden/audiovox/cobra all make good solid FRS radios.
I see your point. I was about to say that the programming in the gmrs must cut the power appropriately for frs channels but as you've so clearly stated, gmrs is all gov documented.
I have a pair of the older 14 channel 1/2 watt audiovox, but I am going to be picking up a pair of waterproof floating 22 channel FRS shortly.  Just trying to decide which.  Sadly most makers do not publish the needed specs on IMD, sensitivity, adjacent channel rejection and so forth.  They publish things like Comes in 5 Great Colors!
The commercial units approved for FRS or GMRS do cut the power automatically based on channel.  Part of being part 95 certified
that is gpg
Now taps, taps, lights out throughout the ship.
nothing special about being built for ms-windows
@ssgtgman , This Motorola FRS is NICE. And legal. Don't spend a ton on FRS. As for GMRS radios, I don't see the point of getting one. After squaring away a nice pair of FRS, I'd look into  handheld digital trunking scanners. Besides, you'll have your hands full with that TS-2000.
I'll have to install Gpg4win on pc and phone.
Yes very valid points. frs it is. I'll check out this site.
You can not install it on a phone.  It is the windows version of gpg

Really that's what our military is concerned with now? lol
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Wednesday the Department of Defense (DOD) will prioritize lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex people in its decision-making processes, according to the top item in an email from the Navy and Marine Corps Daily Media Report.

‚ÄúOn February 4, 2021, the President issued a memorandum directing all U.S. departments and agencies that engage abroad or are involved in foreign aid, assistance, and development programs to undertake a number of actions related to promoting and protecting the human rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex (LGBTQI+) persons,‚Äù the email states.

Blitz -- yes there are state and local meetings.     Check your email for latest info.
Do all FRS radios use the same frequencies?
Yes they do. I have been looking into this a lot based on the discussions here and they share the same 22 channels with GMRS
j am not an experienced radio guy but jpj and AZ have been doing a lot of teaching on this thread

Already have two midlands .just wanted to be sure before I bought another brand. Nice to know I can program the Bao-feng to the same frqs.
According to the FCC and jpj the Baofeng can be used to listen only not transmit. FRS radios are preprogrammed and have to have a non removeable antenna. And they cannot be used in an OK op. Also power output is restricted now to 2 watts. Learned all of this lately LOL just stay legal is all. Scroll back through the thread and you will see the long discussion about this very situation
afternoon patriots, here's to another good day.
good morning everyone, I'm around if any assistance is needed!
I started a telegram channel so we can stay coordinated if this goes down again, and it will allow us to communicate while mobile. It is called "PA Oathkeepers" The link is t.me/paoathkeepers
Hey Viper!
Hey viper141!
Howdy, All.
Hey Redfox!
Hey there!
Hows everyone doing today?
Doing well beautiful cool day outside. Hope all is well with you
Yup! having a pretty awesome day
Know why....Freedom! And thanks to all who have safe guarded it and those who Still stand for it and will continue to Stand against tyranny
Left wing john brown militia and/or redneck revolt..who the fuck are these people...activily recruiting and training......anybody hear chatter about this
I have not what‚Äôs the scoop?
My comms in raleigh tell me the antifa bunch there are mixed in with them....look up john brown gun club..leads to leftist militia stuff
I see that. You knew eventually they would do stuff like that. Like SR said they fear us and that is their countermeasure against us
Alright all stay safe and aware out there! Gotta go feed the kids!
A coyote and woman describe the details of their plan for her and her two children to be trafficked to the US, presumably to claim asylum. The coyote, of course, works for the smuggling cartels. She is bringing small children, because they are her free ticket into the US when claiming asylum.

Fleeing poverty is not a legal justification to be granted asylum status in the US. So, what usually happens is that they claim asylum just to gain entry and then abandon the asylum process to live illegally in the country.

She talks about being short of money, even to start the journey. What often happens is that the cartel gives them credit. They may have to do something illegal to pay back the loan. The cartel will know where her mother and other children are to make sure that she pays the cartel back. If she doesn‚Äôt pay them back her family will be in danger. It is abuse of the children to exploit them in this way. Since she has to pay $5.5 just to start. I suspect the total cost is $11K and half is a loan from the cartel.

The coyote will likely arrange for her to buy a humanitarian visa from a corrupt Mexican official, which makes it much easier to transit Mexico to the US border. The visa also allows her to obtain benefits from the UNHCR (aka the UN refugee agency) as well as other NGO‚Äôs, to provide for their basic needs. The UN refugee agency gives them cell phones and debit cards that they can use to withdraw cash from ATM‚Äôs to buy things for their daily needs.

Far Left militia
"far left" let me guess they're toting around degradable broom sticks?
Not this bunch bubba..recruiting training and well funded
Donsome diggin on them
They are very active in many states.
I suggest a closer look...
Bery organized from what I can out together
well shit.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=qTQjM4XRteZke9YZC) Lol...good one!
haha, i try!
@WKNC what can you tell me about them? I'm interested in knowing what's going on...
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/Comms_Radio_VHF_UHF?msg=3ETiqOx9ubNyR4bJg) @ExASA . Good question. Like @DaveyE7 said, YES, all FRS radios use the same frequencies. 22  frequencies to be exact, sometimes referred to as channels instead of frequencies. Same thing.  The 22 frequencies are pre-programed at the factory. All FRS radio manufactures pre-program their radios with the same 22 frequencies.  Whether you buy a Motorola FRS radio or a Uniden FRS, they're all the same 22 freqs.

It's worth noting, many ham radios will receive FRS frequencies. The catch is, your ham radio will NOT transmit on FRS freqs---FRS freqs are outside the transmitting frequency range that the FCC allows for ham radios. Consequently, if you have a ham radio and want to transmit on FRS, you MUST buy an FRS radio.  The good news is, FRS radios are affordable, easy to find, and easy to use.  

Check out the discussion above for more info.

Here are the 22 FRS freqs (aka channels):

john brown gun club is a left wing militia that actively trains in urban operations
you can see their videos on youtube how they train
so a bunch of commies with guns?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV3H_wLxDWg i found this for more info
not the biggest fan of the woman speaking, but it does it is decent enough info on these people, and there's not many channels speaking out against them either
alright, I have had enough for one day, night y'all! god bless

Good morning all.
Back again. Wow. That hurt.
Good morning Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea!
@FN9 do you have a link to that video that does not require one to have a google/youtube login?
You may find some older 14 channel FRS radios on the used market.  They will of course only be able to speak to other radios on 14 of the 22 new FRS channels.
I would suggest not purchasing a used 14 channel unit.

Because the Commies that are now in power have spent years bringing commies to flag rank in the military and those flag rank commies are doing what the commies in the white house and congress tell them to do.
I want to know how the solder that took that photo was able to do it!  Brave solder!
I am not sure we have any good constitutional officers in the military now.  Maybe a few, but I doubt it is many.
Good morning all! Totally agree with jpj on the officer corps and the bs going on in the DoD right now
‚ÄúThese are the times that try men‚Äôs souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it NOW, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.‚Äù

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=KpJEEGXA7PoJvnCxt) which video?
And obviously from the dust up the DoD had with Tucker the SNCO/PO ranks are getting that way too.
True!  I once knew the MCPO of the USN.  That man would have never pulled that shit, but he was mustered out more than 25 years ago.
Of course using old Soviet bloc weapons also. The appeal of communism ends once it sets in deep and reality shows what the people in power will do even to their own. Idiots but agreed dangerous. More reason for us to organize.
The SNCO‚Äôs of my day where NOT to be messed with, and when I first joined most of the Officers in my squadron where Vietnam Vets and it had a lot different feel to it. There was a separation, when I retired everyone was acting like they where buddies regardless of rank. Nothing wrong with unit cohesion just remember where the line is and what your role is. That‚Äôs what is being blurred now.
Good morning Patriots!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

Waz up
Square away COMMS in 3 STEPS:

*1)  Portable shortwave/AM/FM radio. * Receiving only, ie listening, no transmitting. 
Sounds easy, right? WRONG. It's all the peripheral necessities that will cost you time and money, but you won't be ready for grid down without these...
+ To monitor nationwide and worldwide broadcasts you need a "shortwave" radio, frequencies should range between 30 kHz to 3,000 kHz and 3 MHz to 30 MHz. (aka LF, MF, & HF). Plus FM broadcasting.
+ Radio should run on both home ac power as well as batteries. 
+ Buy extra alkaline and rechargeable batteries.
+ Buy a solar-powered battery charger that can also operate on home ac power.
+ Buy all necessary electrical adapters/cords so you can operate your radio and battery charger in various ways, eg car lighter socket, USB, home ac outlet, etc.
+ Battery tester.
+ Radio should have a flat bottom so you can stand it up on a tabletop if need be. Vertical antennas receive best when vertical.
+ Ear buds or headset for radio.
+ Paper maps (world map, USA map, and state map). If you grew up using Google Maps to get around town, you better buy a city map as well.

Got all that? Next STEP...

*2)  FRS 2-way radios* (Usually sold in pairs.) 
+ These radios have non-removable antenna, FCC certified Part 95, and max power output will be 2.0 watts (see above discussion for more info).
+ These radios are affordable, plentiful, easy to find, and easy to use. No operator license required.
+ Buy radios that are durable and weatherproof.
+ Will likely include a dedicated battery pack, but it should also be adaptable for AAA or AA alkaline or rechargeable batteries. AA battery conversion packs are often made by third party sellers. 
+ If you followed the suggestions above, you will already have extra batteries and a solar charger.
+ Buy all necessary adapters, connectors, and cords for versatility.
+ Buy compatible earpiece/mics (like the FBI uses).
+ Buy durable pouches for your FRS radio that allows you to attach/strap/velcro/molle to your chest rig, backpack straps, or belt.
+ Print extra copies of the radio's owners manual.
+ Buy an affordable soft, protective case to store all this gear IN ONE PLACE. 

Note: Remove batteries from radio when storing longer than a couple months. Tip: Duracell batteries tend to leak.

STEP 3 is optional (good news, eh?)
*3)  Specialty Radios*.  Whether you prefer to simply listen or if you wish to transmit, this is where you expand your comms into specialty areas of interest. These include CB radios, police/ems digital scanners, aircraft bands, GMRS, and ham radio.  This is where it gets complicated, expensive, interesting, and FUN.

There is no such thing as ONE RADIO TO RULE THEM ALL.

Based on newly-discovered secret documents from German archives, diaries, and newspapers of the time, Gun Control in the Third Reich presents the definitive, yet hidden history of how the Nazi regime made use of gun control to disarm and repress its enemies and consolidate power. The countless books on the Third Reich and the Holocaust fail even to mention the laws restricting firearms ownership, which rendered political opponents and Jews defenseless. A skeptic could surmise that a better-armed populace might have made no difference, but the National Socialist regime certainly did not think so‚Äîit ruthlessly suppressed firearm ownership by disfavored groups.
"This year will go down in history. For the first time, a civilized nation has full gun registration! Our streets will be safer, our police more efficient, and the world will follow our lead into the future!"

Google Stephen Halbrook, Nazi Gun registration.
That‚Äôs right. The Nazi‚Äôs targeted a group to demonize and target after a ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù; enacted registration then emergency laws ‚Äúfor the security of the state‚Äù‚Äî then moved on to confiscation of guns from all political opponenets.

Good morning from NC all!
The Jews in the Warsaw ghetto uprising held out for a month when they where able to obtain weapons and ammo. Just simply ran out of both and had to give up but yes restricting access to weapons does work for a regime hell bent on domination and control. Gun control is always and always will be about control. Period!
That‚Äôs absolutely correct. Once they know who‚Äôs got what, then they will come take them. It will be up to the individuals to stand their ground in their homes.

Maybe some kind of regional or national movement will build out from that at some point. Hopefully, Alabama hasn't gone as brainwashed nutso with the NWO BS as they have here.

On a side note, your post here reminds me of how much--for all her flaws--I miss my Dixie home, and hope to return some day. But my fate has me stranded here now, behind enemy lines, a female lone wolf Christian  Nationalist making my last stand for freedom in the Southern Rockies. Hope your not as isolated there as I am here. It seems that being a patriot today is lonely path, so I salute you! Its good that we are here to connect and give moral support to each other. Personally, based on what's happened to this point, I think the most effective strategy for ALL pro-freedom advocates  (not just "patriots," per se)  is to prep to the max and pursue 24/7 100% noncompliance with the medical tyranny (i.e. masks, lockdowns, social distancing, vaccines, testing, contact tracing, etc.--draw a hard final line in the sand there), and creating our own self-reliant, off-the-grid freedom communities (see FreedomCells.org) with whatever like-minded people we can find in our local areas. 

Hopefully, some kind of organized regional or national independence movement will eventually emerge from such an approach, and those committed to defending liberty will begin to unite, especially when the enemy chooses to come after those of us in the rural communities. Which they will! Then, at least, they will be fighting us on OUR turf, a much tougher lift for them than their cowardly staged dramas in the big cities. Sadly, total economic collapse and balkanization of the U.S.--such as the fragmentation of Eastern Europe following the collapse of the USSR in the 1990's--appears inevitable. On the positive side, after some very tough years of re-building--and aside from the Yugoslavian genocide fiasco--that actually worked out pretty well for them, at least for a while. Hopefully, Alabama hasn't gone as full-on brainwashed commie nutso with the NWO BS as they have here in Colorado. As comedian, Ron White, said, "You can't fix stupid." My prayers are with you and the people of Alabama. Drive on, fellow patriot. Feel free to connect with me if you like. For me, it rings truer than ever: "Give me liberty or give me death"....

How are folks doing on communication equipment? Hopefully well.
@chiroeurope , see #Comms_Radio_VHF_UHF chat. We've been adding helpful (and simplified) info, links, and product reviews. 

Suggesting folks start with a portable, battery-powered, shortwave/AM/FM *RADIO *and pair of *FRS 2-way radios*.  Plus all the peripherals.
I'll look into gpg after my ISP is done upgrading my email service.  ETA 4 days.

https://www.sgtreport.com/2021/03/taking-our-country-back-holding-the-criminals-accountable/
@denbo , WELCOME! Glad you made it. I might suggest removing your personal email address from the General forum.  To edit a chat post, hover over the post, click the three dots in the popup option at the right, and select edit.
I am studying for my license as well.  However it's perfectly legal to listen to HAM radio you just can't legally transmit.  Your immediate family can operate under your license to my understanding.  In a SHTF scenario I don't see where having a license will matter, but some aspects to being good at HAM radio are pretty complex and takes a while to learn.  You can buy a relatively cheap handheld dual band for around $100 like the Baofeng BF-F8HP I bought and start familiarizing yourself with the operation until you get your license
That is a good start, a very good start. CB is also useful as it can be powered by a 12V car battery. One radio for those who have there amateur radio permit is an FT8900R by Yaesu. As that gives you 70cm, 2m, 6m, and 10m and with a not serious bit mod'ing can also give you 220 Mhz. Which gives you five bands (analog) on one radio in the US. They are not expensive and can be used mobile and as a base unit. With reasonable range due to the various bands. Only down side is that it is FM only which is not all that bad for many folk.
Only IF you hold your Extra class can your family transmit (and others) but it is very limited. That is one of the areas were the US is in complete agreement with the CEPT accords. Unfortunately I will be having to take all the exams in the US once we get back even though I hold my Full "G" class permit in the UK. The FCC is funny about that.
Glad you clarified for me, thanks
Hi Keeping.AZ! the email is public not private, its the (POC) i hang out there in the open when i need to initiate comms (unless its is a chat policy that i wasn't aware of) #GodBlessTheRepublic
We have one article that supports our good works!
Folks I need to point out some things.....First if you want to know what is and is not legal on ham radio look at FCC regs part 97.
Second if you are serious forget Baofeng radios........They are fine for second radios like a beater car is good for short trips around town, but not good for serious comms.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=NvQT7qsvSq864HiYb) Well done and chilling short movie. Yikes, we're just about there!
Third if you are licensed you can allow anyone to speak over the radio under your control.  That means you are at the physical controls of the transmitter they are using and you can supervise them right there and you can stop the transmission instantly if they are about to violate the rules.
Third any likely SHTF situation that is likely to come along soonish will still have the figureheads in DC in control.  OK will not be going illegal as it will only give them an excuse to send the FBI to visit.
Fourth while you can listen to ham frequencies legally with any receiver that can cover those frequencies it is very unlikely that you will be able to effectively operate on those frequencies with either patriot hams or others after SHTF.  You will not know what you are doing with respect to operating the radios, you will probably not know procedures, and the chances of any hams speaking to you once they figure out you are not licensed is slim.
Sorry, didn't mean to start a shitstorm
If you want to be a really good communications resource find a local ham radio club.  Take their classes, and get involved in the local ARES group.  Since not all of them will be liked minded do not tell them about OK or your strong feelings for the Constitution.  Just use it as a platform to learn.
To be good at Comms you have to do it.  Just like being good at shooting or flying.  The newer you are the more often you have to do it and practice the skills.
A skilled ham can set up a comms link with hardly a thought and make it work.  That is the kind of comms guy we need in OK, but it only comes from actually doing it and getting trained and integrated with the ham radio community.
If you were a military radio op chances unless it was more than 30 years ago you probably were using highly engineered and automated systems that did the work for you.
@stfletcher you did not stir up anything.  I just want to make sure that folks understand what goes into being good at comms, and make sure they have realistic expectations.  If you never picked up a rifle before and you had to grab one, load it, and become effective with it you will be in sad shape when the zombies come!  Same with comms.

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=qTyJe36HYoLYs2PTN) Thank you for sharing! I thought it was an extremely relevant and stimulating discussion that could well prove critical to an overall effective strategy for us, to force the restoration of our rights under the Constitution through the courts. Knowledge is definitely power, and this is some very important legal theory that I had not known of prior to seeing the video (the powers-that-be have been very successful in concealing it until now!). That said, I truly feel that, at this point, legal defense and freedom advocacy organizations are too little, too late, and such court fights over minutia in the the legal process, admiralty law, corporate jurisdiction, winning monetary settlements, etc. ultimately plays into to the hands of the tyrants. If such strategies were going to work, they would have already done so. Some of these organizations have been around for decades doing the same thing, and we continue to lose ground big time. 

Bottom line: the enemy is going to do what he is going to do (the courts be damned!) and its clear to me that, overall, our Judicial Branch is just as irredeemably corrupted, overall, as the other two branches. As demonstrated by the stolen 2020 election, in one voice, they all serve the hidden globalist corporate powers they discuss in the video, that they now have virtually total rule over our lives. "Dominion" indeed! As in the case of the Las Vegas casino, the house always wins. While you may be able to point to one or two success stories to counter this argument, the momentum is overwhelmingly on the opposite side. Sadly, I believe that we must accept that we'll ever get a fair hearing on these matters in the courts, with or without the involvement of N.A.F.T. Its definitely a top-notch freedom advocacy organization with strong principles and solid leadership, and could well have a significant role to play in the outcome (as could a couple of other such organizations I know of). However, as far as a primary organization/strategy to focus on in this battle, I am convinced that our response needs to be a much more robust, immediate and decisive one.

Public protests, education campaigns, recall efforts and waiting for the courts to act, while all having their place, have utterly failed us and gotten us to the point we are now at, where we almost powerless to even communicate with each other, due to the blatant enemy censorship and cyber attacks against our digital networks. I truly believe a combination of secession and determined mass civil disobedience (backed by our Constitutionally authorized use of force, if they push it any further) to counter this criminal government overreach is the only approach likely to be successful. War crimes are being perpetrated daily against our people on an unprecedented and escalating level. For sure, I am a woman of peaceful resolution, wherever such is possible. I have been all my life. I don't see it being possible under the current circumstances. I hope I'm wrong, but I doubt it.

The main question we need to be asking ourselves right now and going forward is, how much more destruction to our country and our way of life are we willing to accept before we act? One thing I'm sure of is, that we cannot keep playing by their rules and expect to win. Just sayin'....How was that for some feedback, guys?
What hurt?
thanks jpj! - appreciate the assist!
I have not read all of these, so we have to check that they support OK being good guys, then decide what to say in the article that will use these for support.
Greetings fellow Texans! looking to make comms with any team leaders/coordinators in the Harris county/Houston area - email: denbo420@gmail.com - time to stand & be counted, just had a nice freeze & hurricane season will be here in no time!.. then there's that 'current' Constitutional dilemma staring us in the face! #OathKeeper4Life
https://reason.com/tag/oath-keepers/   lots of OK news to check and see if it is usable.
@stfletcher , @Jordon_Janelle , @lonestarhog , and @chiroeurope , WELCOME to the shitstorm . . . 
and #Comms_Radio_VHF_UHF !  :laughing:
Thanks! I added another notch to my Wiki contribution requirement.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=meT83cSdH6DRZjmfk) It's not an OKers policy. Just a suggestion.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=PNKYCGQkxJ7ahyMc4) I agree! We need that  kind of passion right now! Does our generation have it? I would rather die in the first wave against this enemy, and be part of what could be known as "the greatest generation," than live to old age, having submitted to a tyranny that I might have been instrumental in vanquishing.
The IM service is secure in transit.  The data at rest on the disk is not encrypted, so if the server is captured the data can be read.  Unless the person is an ADMIN at this point you can not tell if they are vetted.
GPG goes on your end device, not on the mail server.
So I see. Folks are quoting section of the reg's out of context. IF things go to a SHTF condition I am NOT going to stop transmitting to someone just because they don't have an FCC number. Then again I am former CB land in the US, military com's in MP's and ENG and UK G class which was when they still required the practical's to get to that level. Folks need to work together on getting com's up and in place. It was one of the things I was going to offer folks was a design I sell. As it is water proof to 5 minutes under water with the ports that would hold the elements plugged. To members it would be free even though it is also helping move my family back to the US. The data is a 3MF file and instruction on how to build it. Wide band (all of 70cm at or below 1.4 SWR for the whole band). If this is the shit storm then we need to get our own house in order as we have folks who are not focusing on the issues and instead worried about things that need to be accounted for but not central issues. From what I see here I doubt anyone has taken the time to think of using the 2.3Ghz and up for com's and MESHnet systems. Which given what we have experienced with the website down and other issues is something to take very very seriously. Also helps with emergencies of weather and other non constitutional type levels. I am MM0MSU and volunteer with RAYNET and also can give my LT# if needed from 2013. Folks we need to be helping folks not being jerks nor trying to annoy them by dictating opinion as fact.
I have it on each of my laptops and on my phone.
I can print wifi/micro wave antenna's. I have designed wide banned dipoles that can be used vertical or horizontal. I have set up emergency com's and manned as back up con-com for an emergency condition for over 48 hours (luckily my XYL who is also a G class let me get some sleep after the first 42 hours. I work with folks who are pushing the edge on MESH for emergency com's as the government here can't wipe their backside with a map and a flashlight AND directions. So please tell me we are not dealing with the ego BS here on comm's as that is the last thing we need right now.
Print= 3D printing and once back in the US, being able to CNC them as well.
We also need to teach folks CW as that is NOT used by the idiots who want to control thing most interestingly enough and an area I will openly admit that I need to improve.
@chiroeurope , welcome aboard! Glad you're here. We're fortunate to have your knowledge and experience!
Hello folks. I am a Michigander living in the UK working on getting family home. Hope things are going okay and that folks are working towards removing the criminals from office.
Whoever is doing the vetting must be swamped! 

I'm happy to give you my info here via IM, if you're helping the vetting team. It'll take 5 minutes to vet me. I'm not hard to find on the internet.
Will help as able and do what I can. Right now my biggest goal is getting family back into the US as the section of the UK I am in is a Soviet Socialist government and too many folks think that is okay.
Looking forward to having you back in the USofA. You're coming back just in time for the Leftist communist takeover!
No I am coming home to help stop the leftist attempt at a take over. They don't have the resources they want folks to think they have. They are dependent on apathy more than anything. This is why they are pushing a lot of false flags and PsyOp's disconnects. The more folks are expecting someone else to save the the easier it is to control.
The EU is in the middle of madness and China is trying to keeps it's population from open revolt. This is why they want the US weak and to create more strife and war.
The CIS (Russia) is not interested in the US at present. They have enough issues with keeping they economy going and dealing with the threat of the radical Muslims in their section of the world.
If things go well, I will be part of the folks who help restore small to mid size business and also move the energy sector out of the control of big business. Unfortunately it means that I or my wife will have to get in politics which is ugly at best.
The "enemy" is China and home grown progressives and those who support the UN idea of a single world governmental system. Trekkies are a big section of this following. Only they don't understand that the utopia they want is funded on death and lies.
@chiroeurope , regarding "ego BS," you won't have to worry about that around here. Most members are former military and LE---an ego-free zone.  :laughing:
@chiroeurope most hams will just not speak to an unlicensed person under any circumstances.  Hell I was listening on the air when someone I helped with her studies got on the air and because she was not 100% on her game the local crowed stopped talking to her on the repeater, and in fact told her to get off the air until she got a license.
Not sure what you mean by teach folks "CW"  - Should I post a schematic of a hartley oscillator?
Perhaps the idea is teach folks Morse Code.  Good luck with that.  It is hard enough getting folks to commit to learning entry level theory, regs, and operating procedure.  I do agree though that everyone should know how to send by hand and rx by ear morse code.  While all the computerized modes preform better than CW for SNR who the fuck wants to lug about a computer and have it suck up extra power just to pass a simple message.
I got my Technician, General, and Extra on April 6, 2013.  Setup a CB Base Station, UHF/VHF Handheld, Yaesu Ham Station, FRS/GMRS Station, then got busy with many other things and only hit transmit to respond to Hams Contesting, while working in my shop. :rolling_eyes:   I guess it is about time to blow off the dust, run some equipment checks, and get in the game. :cowboy:
@windy some of us have achieved old age, but I can still Fight, F??? or run a Footrace.
@lonestarhog Yep.  If you have not practiced you may have a hard time making a circuit when it counts.  If you have not used the equipment for a while it just may not work.  Skills and equipment need regular use.
Truth Matters.
A false witness will perish,
But the man who listens to the truth will speak forever. Prov 21:28
Hope. Or as some call hopium.
Some can see. Some can see when shown. Some can not see.
See video below and note the foreign military veterans protecting the citizens of their home country. As should we. Also note the comparison between the military and illegal immigrants by our fake president. Finely, notice the (WE) The People of the world who have had it and are standing up to be counted in the streets of their country. Good outnumbers evil.
:woozy_face: SIGH!  So true...
I can still do all 3 at once...most days
I haven't confirmed specific accounts shown on the video below but if true seems like N.A.F.T. is making headway and worth supporting or at least looking closer to follow up and look for progress. Solutions will come from the bottom up. Do you know your sheriff? If not, why? Is your sheriff a constitutional sheriff? Upholding the rule of law starts at the county level. All elected officials and their systems of control  must be held accountable at the county level.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuwYw5Kg4CI&t=99s
There is strength in numbers.
I am on the air at a minimum 3 times a week and I rotate through my equipment.  From a how to make a circuit or pass a message point of view I can step in at any time and do that correctly even if I have not been on the air for a while, but back in the 1970s when I got my first license I was on the air every day and I was rigging new home built antennas frequently.  I have so much experience now that really my getting on the air 3 or more times a week is to make sure the equipment is working well.
Sadly because I do not have a good operating position I seldom operate CW, thus my morse skills leave something to be desired.  I am down from 20wpm to probably around 5.  A goal for this year is to rebuild my shack to allow for a good spot to operate CW.
Sadly in NYC our MULTIPLE sheriffs are appointed!
I am only doing vetting in NYC at the moment.  SR wants vetting to be face to face if possible.  It is going to be a slow process I fear.  My first in person meeting will probably be next week.
Good morning from Meck Co. Stay strong patriots!
Agreed. And nicely put!
:smiley: Dang, you got chops. Glad you're on OUR SIDE!
_"I truly believe a combination of secession and determined mass civil disobedience (backed by our Constitutionally authorized use of force, if they push it any further) to counter this criminal government overreach is the only approach likely to be successful"_ --- @windy .

I think I'm in LOVE! 

Windy, are you married???
feedback for @windy : We need to get right minded folks organized before anything can be done.  Some of the things like recalls, court fights and such have to be done as part of an overall raise awareness campaign and to also give us some things to point to to organize.
Huh? We're not nuking Portland from orbit?
The organization needs to happen on the local level in towns and counties outside of places that are Democrat controlled hell holes like NYC, Portland, Chicago, DC, LA, Philly and PGH.  Then we have to let them come to us just like on Lexington Green.
Our forefathers did not run down to Boston where the enemy was strong, neither should we run at the enemy.  We let him come to us in the country.   Let our country county militia form up at that time.  If the Feds send men to confiscate guns the town or county militia has to stand against them, but we have to be trained and smart.
At the moment we are neither trained, nor smart.  There are lots of folks on the right screaming "from my cold dead hands", but I do not see them training and drilling with their neighbors.  Our forefathers spent years on talk and political solutions, but at the same time they were training, electing leaders for the coming fight and getting strong in an environment the enemy would not be good in.
We must do the same.
We must also reach, teach and inspire.  We must especially reach out to the national guard units in our own communities.  Remind them of their oath and what it means.  We really do not want to be in a position of having to fire on our fellow american warriors.  We want them to either stand down and refuse unlawful orders or we want them to understand the imperative to remove from office all domestic enemies of the constitution, even if some of them are flag rank officers and elected public servants.
@jpj , Good points all. There is, however, an essential element of the modern equation requiring consideration. By 1775, the militia system had been a legal, widely practiced way of life for over 100 years, right up to "the shot heard 'round the world" at Lexington.  The militia system was woven into the daily fabric of our communities, in part out of necessity providing a common defense against hostile Indians. 

Today, the militia system has been absent from our daily lives for more than 100 years (thanks to W.Wilson and the Progressive movement).  Not only is it not practiced, it is roundly ridiculed, persecuted, and soon to be outlawed as "domestic terrorism."   

This is an obvious FACT we must honestly take into account.  Despite advances in communication and firearms, Americans are actually LESS prepared and organized to confront tyranny today than were colonists in 1775. Isn't that ultimately the cause of frustration we OKers feel right now? No organization?

I think we have to be honest with ourselves---how are circumstances the same today as they were in 1775, and how are they different. What would our Founding Fathers do today given our circumstances.  That's the question.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=E4yPBZ55yJJu3QBPS) Excellent points! Learning so much from all of you, especially @Keeping.AZ and the other true historians here. This is the core of the discussion we are needing to focus on. 

First off, I believe our Founding Fathers today would have first have clearly defined our enemy as China, the central banks, and the military-industrial complex (we warned of long ago by both Eisenhower and JFK of the latter, ,although today its morphed into Big Pharma/Big Tech). They would definitely have had the same moral resolve they had back then, but they would certainly not have based their defense on a conventional firearms. Rather, they would have "fought fire with fire," and used all expedient means to defeat the enemy (to include cutting-edge psyops and counter-propaganda techniques against the corporate media and cyber-warfare--Franklin would surely have invented some revolutionary Nikola Tesla-type--technology to turn the tables on Silicon Valley and the NSA, thus gaining the technological advantage). Having taken down the enemy's command and control (not to mention their propaganda machine and money supply!) they would have executed pinpoint commando sabotage attacks on strategic command and control targets, disrupting the luciferian vaccination program while they were at it, exposed the Deep State cabal, discrediting the whole NWO/Marxist critical race theory narrative in the process. Disrupting BLM/Antifa would have been a piece of cake for them, as they are all packed into the communist-run big cities. I am also assuming their more brilliant patriot scientists (with some help from select allied foreign scientists) would have invented and deployed their vastly superior pulse weapons to disable the enemy's HAARP weather-control center and fledgling EMP space weapons program, etc.. 

In other words, they would have soundly defeated this enemy at their own game, and at every level,' leveraging to the max their superior intellect and tactical advantages, and outsmarting the enemy at their own game via their own version of "unrestricted warfare." Oh, and they most definitely would have found a way to take out the Federal Reserve :-) And for all you Trump fans out there, there's no way they would have let the enemy gain control of the voting process with their foreign-made, satellite-controlled voting system. Trump got played royally there, as well as by Fauci, Gates and their covid scam, which was the primary cause of his ouster. We should cut ties with the U.N. 50 years ago. If nothing else, a democracy is based on the integrity of its electoral system. We the People lost control of it, and this is price we paid.

How are circumstances the same or different than today? As indicated above, I would say its definitely the technology aspect, the more agriculturally-based economy, and the more apathetic populace, willing to trade their freedoms away for a little bit of security or convenience. We've been way too comfortable with our electronic gadgets and toys, to see through their mind-control games. Not sure how we address all these challenges, but nevertheless, those are the strategic challenges we face today.

Interested to hear the responses to that analysis. Do you think I'm that far off base with it?
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=xSrEpSyM8Z6ebnW2X) Absolutely agree there! You put your finger on it. That's a major challenge, in itself. Seriously, though, I have some ideas that I'm working on there too, that I'm planning to beta test with my own recruitment strategy. Basically, we need to look it as a type of (mental) software programming, like they do. Will share as I see potential in those strategies. I just fear that if we don't up our game and become more aggressive on the counter-propaganda front, we may irretrievably lose the initiative. I'll figure out how to deprogram Colorado, if you have New York covered for us on it.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=v4pxq5jvma32BY9v5) Just an opinion, but if we assume (as with the Continental Army) we'll have to carefully choose our battles, then Portland would seem to represent a lost cause. So, just gaming it out for discussion of possibilities, I say why not just withdraw from that whole urban West Coast theater (giving heads up for patriots to evacuate to the Heartland), and then just cut off their supply lines and let the enemy "nuke" himself. 

Then we can just move in afterwards for mop up operations and, if we choose to, begin the rebuilding operation, under provisional Conservative leadership, with Constitutional rule restored. At least they'll take down Hollywood and Big Tech/Silicon Valley with them as collateral damage. If Northern California is committed to seceding (as I've heard may be the case), then we could provide support for them, using it as our West Coast operations launching platform. The strategy here is keep the leftists confined to their hell-hole cities they've already trashed, while we consolidate our forces in the heartland and the Southern states.

Hopefully, all the patriots will have evacuated those areas by the time they implode. Sadly, as with the former East German Republic, it seems inevitable that those West Coast centers of leftist "power" are doomed to collapse under the weight of their own iniquity. Especially with their food lines to the East cut off. Only then, do we have a chance of picking up the pieces there, to save what's left. While my hope is for a peacefully negotiated secession solution--and I know it sounds like its way out there at this point--I believe these are realistic scenarios we could very soon be faced with. We might as well THINK BIG, if we're going to fight for her, guys, as we may only have one chance at it. If we're able, even briefly, to gain the upper hand with an all-out, well-planned counter-attack, then we could hope that would be just enough to get the millions of fence-sitters--including the military and law enforcement--to our side, turning the tide decisively in our favor.

We would still be facing our own "Yorktown" showdown (with what's left of the criminals, probably barricaded behind their barbed-wire fence in DC), but as I remember, things ended up looking pretty good for the patriots at that point in their campaign. At the very least a negotiated secession (and freedom and liberty for our children and future generations) could be attained...The plan obviously needs some fleshing out by greater minds than mine, but just some food for thought. We have to figure out a way to take control of the narrative, neutralize the enemy's propaganda machine, and seize the initiative before its too late.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=a4PkWBXuiwuWJWaZ9) No, I'm not married @Keeping.AZ  I'm single and open to proposals of marriage ;-) But, be careful what you wish for. I've been told I'm a bit of a handful...lol
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=BekTJvbHSpKfcsign) No doubt you can do ALL that incredibly better than those drugged-out,  gender-fluid Green New Commies! Remember, age is just a number, and its the F???'ing part that counts the most anyway, right?
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=TmYR5AjE5wKgfm2ZB) I say let's teach 'em a lesson and sink ''em for target practice. in prep for the big one against the ChiComs. Those Ruskies have been allowed to run rampant for far too long!
CW = Constant Wave. International shorthand for Morse code. Even used by the FCC to refer to Morse code (machine and manual).

I am on daily on VHF/UHF and DMR (TG2355). Have dealt with the snobs here as well and there are many unfortunately. I know folks who will not answer three young folks who have their foundation permit. I find it rude and someone needs to give them a swift kick in the backside.

As far as "BS" on forums, even here; well my membership date started in 2013. I remember the original forum and much that went on there. I also remember folks leaving and being banned who were former military or LEO's. I remember the DDOS attack on the website during the Bundy ranch issues. I also know that I have clay feet don't know everything and that the goal/mission needs to be defined so that a monkey can understand it (I have been the monkey, as most of us have at some time or another).

I am still more than willing to put the design up for folks as it is a good design and gives a low/no gain antenna that is highly weather resistant and very wide banded for the band that a person choses to build it for. Getting it to members might be an issue but that should be able to be over come. That or I just send the design to HQ and let them figure out how to deploy the unit with folks that can use it. Though most likely that would be the best idea as also setting up a mobile relay module that will allow for 2m, 70cm, (23CM possible), and a 2.4/5.0 Ghz microwave/wifi set up to allow emergency Comm's support for local resources that we are working with. This is something that can be set up on either adhoc or as permeant units. Here we have coverage from the Kingdom of Fife to the Borders and slightly past Sterling on nine units that are linked (the 5GHz needs a good LOS for getting the signal).
Best lesson is feed the folks in the city and get folks working and being secure in their community and income. These are the things that the Democrat's and progressives are directly attacking right now
I tried to send a long message and that did not work so I will send in chunks.
The Moscow Times = newish version of RT = Red Herring source. Whose goal is stirring the pot of strife and pushing an agenda favored by one of their backers when they were starting which is the Open Society. Need I say more???
The bigges issue is supporting the police while NOT supporting stazi nor those who misuse their position to abuse the public. Unfortunately as the continued polarization happens you will get more stazi as the us or them position gets pushed more and more.
Which is one of the reasons that pushing for elected Sheriff's and County based law enforcement is very important. That and aiding as able for families to home school or to have local education academies that actually teach and not indoctrinate. All do able but not easy. As folks still want to have items that are not really needed. Like that iPhone or most modern items for sale that are marketed on TV.
Good morning kt2806!
Good morning all! Looks like a very deep discussion last night! Wow excellent points all! Long term goals for sure but organizing at the local level is tantamount to success!

Now THAT'S what I call thinking outside the ammo box!
If you really want to see Progressive :clown: heads explode - as I have done on numerous occasions - tout *The Civilian Marksmanship Program*> https://thecmp.org/about/ <I have stated that all American schools, both public and private, should begin weaponry training in the First Grade.  It would begin with basic history and understanding about how cultures have been both dominated and liberated by the use of weapons - all types.  As the students progress, they would learn things like the various parts of a cartridge, various types of handguns and rifles, etc.  Eventually, LASER training would begin, possibly around 10-years old.  Grades 9-12 would include training on a tactical range. This training should continue through the 12th grade, where the final year would include live fire qualification.  Imagine the educated - no irrational fear of weapons - and trained populace that America would have.  Yup!  You can picture the Progressive heads when this was proposed. :cowboy:
Morning ladies and gents. I am here, late for the party as usual...
@lonestarhog , sadly, today the Left dominates the world of education.
Actually there is massive push back by the homeschooling and homestead communities. Also with inner city homeschool academies/choice academies. These are people looking for ways to improve their lives without having to give over to big government and they truly believe in community. There are a small section that are liberals who think that they can make a utopia by going farther left then the current mainstream but they are not the majority.

Reach out to these groups and help get programs started. Also remember that the founding fathers listed arms not just guns. as a cudgel can be just as deadly as a firearm in the right pace and used properly. As can a simple kitchen knife (which is why the SNP and Greens in Scotland are trying to control even those). You would be surprised at the community that is out there. They just need folks to help them and aid them in ways that also aid us. Buy local and seasonly. I know more ways to make truly wonderful tasting food from basic ingredients then most. Though I have lived in many places and always eaten local and seasonly. Cheaper that way. As a side note IF there is interest in Haggis or Wiskey let me know as the Biden Government has left a loop hole for single malt wiskey at the moments and it is not taxed at the same level as blended wiskeys are. So now is the time to buy it when you will pay less. Haggis can be shipped directly to a person for personal use as long as it is packaged for retail sale here.
one goal that could be done by member on helping avoid another DDOS being able to actually take the site down is setting up a fully legal amateur MESHnet that links groups and comm's. Which would be in the 2.4 to 5 Ghz band range and would give a reasonable distance with using easily 3D printed horn antennas.

That and reaching out to local pastors and farmers to help insure that folks eat who need to.

Also NOT spending the money that Biden is giving out on consumer goods NOR putting it into the hands of wallstreet to eat up, but buying silver. As IF we are at the beginning of a forced collapse of the US dollar and a created hyper inflation stage the best option is to NOT have the money in a form that will be direct affected by the devaluation of the dumping of currency on the market and forcing devaluation of labor by increasing the minimum wage. There by hitting more folks with taxes while making the money worth even less. Moving it to silver and sitting on it and only converting what you need or paying in silver will do serious damage to the control that is being tried to be put in place.
Good morning Patriots!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Great posts this morning, @chiroeurope . 

Regarding homeschooling, expect the Left to outlaw it.  As well as charter schools. They will also eliminate the tax advantages afforded parochial schools.
You might be surprised as there are groups that many would call left that are pushing for more home schooling rights not less. This is why bridge building must be done so that groups can support each other and the result being stronger community.
We're in an interesting phase of the Radical Left's takeover of the United States. It may be a blessing OKers, III%, and patriots are not prepared at the moment to initiate a coordinated response. 

How do I mean? 

We're in this early phase of the Leftist takeover---election coup.  The average American still assumes the 2020 election results were accurate, fair and square. As Biden's dementia becomes more obvious, average Americans are going to question the media's role in deceiving the public.  Soon Biden will be forced out of office and Kamala will be sworn in. Kamala will then select a VP, perhaps Hillary. It's at THAT point, average Americans will be saying "What a second . . . Hillary? Something smells fishy." 

The Left tends to overplay their hand in US politics.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=ST4yFZXbQEQRacP94) That looks like an awesome program for kids! Love it. Let's not let the progressive clowns dissuade us. As an educator, this needs to be a component of the new curriculum
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=cDaveQbkWLLcDNY7C) Very true. Yes, overplaying their hand is one of their main weaknesses, but its truly amazing to watch how successful they've been so far with that strategy, and how Americans by and large have been willing to swallow. Very disconcerting, but I am encouraged by your sense that they may still wake up to what has happened. Myself, I see where I fell for so much of this kind media manipulation for years, until March, 2020, so I now see the mechanism by which they operate. But I imagine Hillary being selected for VP would definitely alert even the BS detectors of even the most brainwashed American! Hopefully, we will be in a much better position to strike at that point.
Bravo-echo this is not the first time that they have done things like this. There were issues during the Brady Ranch issue with moles on all sides. Heck scuttlebutt has the reason that the first forum was shut down was due to intentional misquoting of posts off of the forum and that folks had found ways of breaching the security that it had.
That depends on how much folks stand up and be counted in this up coming election. The more folks who go and get certified as electors and as poll workers the harder it is for them to put forward their agenda. The more folks who work with the pro open election groups the better for everyone.
Having rule of law is work, as that requires the citizens to keep the government honest and to be active in it's function.
Folks don't want to be bothered these days though that is changing.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=RhmmeJ4rpia8Js65q) Wow! They;re either having some serious security issues over there at Antifa Central, or I would be very suspicious about this report. It wouldn't put it beyond them to use such tactics (after all, this is unrestricted warfare we're in) but what are they infiltrating, organizations sworn to defend the Republic. I don't think such plants would be hard to spot, but we need to be constantly vigilant about security. To a certain extent, there isn't much we can do, if they are willing to go so low with their blows, except decide how we're going to deal with traitors within our own ranks. This is going to get down and dirty guys, as if it hasn't already! Just the tip of the iceberg. Maybe we need to look at infiltrating the FBI?
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=z2xTykFRG26iWrfuY) @chiroeurope , I'm afraid I don't share your optimism for the future of elections.  The 2020 election fraud proved the lengths to which the Left will go to seize power.  Now in power, the Left will institutionalize electoral fraud, guaranteeing a one-party system.  

There won't be another free and fair election until after the next civil war.
There is no optimism it is going to be hard work and might be what causes a civil war. Though doing nothing and not getting involved is letting the game go as they want and that is never good for anyone.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=MXi97PJocPRngku3A) @chiroeurope , Doing nothing is what the Left is hoping for and counting on.  Hence the examples of punishment OKers are suffering under the DOJ in DC. 

I am committed to disappointing the Left.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=RhmmeJ4rpia8Js65q) Wow! They;re either having some serious security issues over there at Antifa Central, or I would be very suspicious about this report. It wouldn't put it beyond them to use such tactics (after all, this is unrestricted warfare we're in). But let's think about this and not let them get the best of us here: What is it exactly do they think they are they infiltrating? OK is an established nonprofit organization, in book as American as apple pie, with a sterling reputation as an advocate for freedom of liberty, sworn to defend the Republic (which is why I joined it). I don't think such plants as in the article would be hard to spot, but we need to be constantly vigilant about security. To a certain extent, there isn't much we can do, if they are willing to go so low with their blows, except decide how we're going to deal with treason within our own ranks. We cannot allow them to succeed with re-branding us as "domestic terrorists" in the average persons mind. We must defend the honor of our organization in the in the court of public opinion, while also being wary to the fundamental psycops aspect of this war--i.e. keeping our eye on the ultimate aim of restoring Constitutional rule. This ties in closely with what @Keeping.AZ 's recent spot on observation, that the average American has imbibed the Kool Aid and is asleep at the wheel, at least until they overplay their hand to the degree of doing something having Kamala pick someone like Hillary as VP when Joe bites the dust. This is going to get down and dirty guys (as if it hasn't already!). Just the tip of the iceberg. I am seriously concerned with our vulnerability to cyber attack on our comms here, more than anything else. Maybe we need to look at infiltrating the FBI?
But...but...butt...it appears that only the Federal Bureau of Insurrectionists :poop: are dumb enough to attempt the "infiltration" of an IDEA. ("Antifa is an idea, not an organization" - Joe Da Sniffer Biden) :cowboy:
Sorry, but having to be the bearer of more bad news for you all. Check it out! SGTReport and N.A.F.T. founder, Rick Martin, was falsely arrested on Contempt of Court charges in a Michigan State courtroom yesterday, while legally assisting a business owner there, fighting to keep her business open against the tyranny of the state. He and his guest, Mark Emery were talking about all this in that video someone posted just the other day! I don't know if Rick is an OK member, but we definitely need to show maximum support to him and any other freedom fighters standing up for the Constitution. That said, this perfectly illustrates my main point, that the U.S. court system--like the other two branches of government--is totally compromised and has been subsumed by our enemies in the Deep State (DOJ, FBI, NSA, CCP, ATF, all of it). Like the OK patriots falsely set up and arrested at the legal Stop the Steal rally in DC on 1/6, could have been any one of us. Just another patriot exercising his or her God-given rights. It plain for all to see that they are coming after us HARD, and we're sure to keep losing if we continue to play their game on their terms. Time to think outside of the box. Time for disciplined, but unrestricted warfare.

All this talk about the next elections is foolish. With HR1 in the works, there will be no free elections. If it gets passed we will officially become a Banana Republic
Just checking to see if you got the last email?
A good starting point for newbies: Ham Radio Crash Course...Tech site; HTTP://hrcc.stream/techlicense    General: http://hrccstream/genlicense
Do we have channels anymore?
Please help our FL/OK Patriots
There are two choices then.

1) Is to get the evidence to a court or the American people to prove the fraud that is out in the open and do so in a manner that leaves no doubt that it happened and who did it. That WILL require serious resources.

2) The second is upholding the document that the US Constitution is based upon to the fullest. That will not be pretty. 

In all honesty neither of them will be pretty. Not fighting in the election and not working to STOP bad actions by being the thorn in the side and doing protests and working to expose bad actors and continue to expose the criminal activity in government and working with folks to make things happen.

You want Michigan to stop being an issue to list one of the hot spots? Fine the charge is violation of MCL 750.505. The evidence is from the legal case in Antrium county were there is complete evidence the SoS violated State and Federal law in ordering voting machines wiped. That the Governor used her office in violation of the Michigan Supreme Court and the Michigan Constitution. That is one case. That requires finding folks on the ground to file the charges and finding a Judge who is willing to deal with the violence that will be let loose against them.

New Mexico, contempt of the state congress; the list goes on. Are folks willing to organize and file the charges. Are folks willing to put it on the line.  What I am typing here under the laws of the country I am in and the political party currently in power could cost me my family. Yet still I will say it.
If not, it was this

I did join the Navy a few years back but ended up getting separated due to an issue with a pilonidal and a shoulder injury that happened on my end. I don't typically state myself as a veteran due to me not actually believing that I served long enough to actually call myself one as it just honestly feels wrong. I could dig up the DD-214 if it could help. And yes the 361-92-8532 is indeed my SSN.


As for the reason why I screwed up the SSN the first time. I from time to time just end up having a spout of stupid and accidentally mix up the first three of mine with another family members. Happens occasionally. 

Like I said I can easily dig up my DD-214 from the separation and can also say that the medical issues are more or less resolved to where they aren't actually much of an issue anymore. 
Well after much homework, I finally made my FRS purchase. Pretty much all radios are made overseas these days so trying to stick to a US product didn't seem feasible. This company has great product quality & support reviews and the specs check check out as written on YouTube tech checks. It was one of only a couple of FRS units that put out the full 2 watts. For anyone looking for their first or looking to upgrade here she is.  https://www.buytwowayradios.com/wouxun-kg-805f-mr.html
Can you send the plans pdf or is it a special file type? Is a 3D printer required or can we fabricate with aluminum or fiberglass? Very interested in home brew and tactical antenna systems.
I'm very interested in your antenna plans. Anything I can do to help build them or anything else I can do to help with preparedness please let me know.
Hey dman welcome
When I was a JROTC instructor they had an air rifle program that we could enact with the schools permission of course. And of course my school said no as did the entire district. All the branches had it and could compete against each other. Would have loved to be able to that
I hear ya chiroeurope, but even the Supreme Court has show itself unwilling to uphold the law or even take a look and see if anything was in violation. It is NOT going to be easy to uncluster this cluster that has been made you are correct. Not sure if courts will be of any help, some maybe but then it depends on the next level because you know there will be endless appeals and such legal bs. I agree if HR 1 goes into effect then we will not have fair elections for a long time. I do hope the state AG‚Äôs will sue but then we are in the courts again and who knows where that will go. Maybe THAT would move the Supreme Court. Maybe. Just my thoughts, in this to win...

Hi KAZ,
What's up, ssgt?
I was looking at you com prep list. And checking out different equipment
Let me send you this link on a 7 band RX two band TX
Are you ham licensed?
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/Comms_Radio_VHF_UHF?msg=QN4RtzABCExMaWjy8) No working on it
I just got my Tech. Working on General.
looking now...
I watched a YouTube clip on it yesterday. It over produced on the rated power just a bit and the other thing was that it TXd on am witch makes it a try a band TX. Though not listed that way
I'll see if I can find that YouTube clip
I look forward to your thoughts
Looks great!  Love the duel band, wideband Rx radios.  This is a great radio for those of us with Tech licenses, VHF/UHF privileges. Lots of features. And I trust HRCC's advice.  Only two things I might consider: will I get good service from the manufacturer, and is a digital-capable radio something I can wait to buy later (this Wouxun appears to be analog only).  Check with jpj about the digital capability.  He's the Elmer. I'm the Elmo.  

Hah! I'm excited for you. Awesome!
Right it's not digital but as far as that goes and from the videos I've watched on digital radios, it will be quite a learning curve before I'm ready for anything in that arena. Support wize, I've seen only good responses from people in that regard.
Chances are you'll own 3 new radios before you move into digital anyway. 

I'm new to ham too. It's a STEEP learning curve for someone like me who knew nothing about electricity.
I was an elevator repair technician for 25 years. I wasn't one of the rocket scientists but it all grows on you in time. So you have you have your tech license or did you knock out the general class test at the same time?
As the radio count goes. I bought 4 U:-5R
Can't edit hear sorry.
4 UV-5R some years ago but now they are not worth the risk of using. I've since got the Kenwood TS-2000 and just ordered to clean FRS radios but that one I sent you looks like a lot of radio for the money. So that one will be coming home soon. Have to hit the books for the HAM test.
file type is 3MF. Which is used for 3D printing. I could do a work up of the unit in a pdf. But it is mainly meant to be 3d printed as with PETG or ASA it is UV resistant and water resistant as well. For members, I will gladly give you the file for personal use or use with OK but otherwise I am trying to sell the files to help with the move back to the US. It also comes with a PDF that is the assembly and notes on printing/materials.
Will let you know and sent a reply to your message on the thread in the communication section. Also there is horn wifi antennas that I have downloaded, tested and working on improving that would give wifi/microwave comm's to folks which is a good amount of data over very good distance at the right height and properly set up.
I don't have access to a 3D printer. But if you'd care to give me a peek at it I would appreciate it. The microwave stuff is way out of my league.
I like Baofeng UV5Rs. I've got 3 of them. My FRSs are an older model of Motorola Talkabouts, clean, legal. Funny, my toy-like FRSs have better reception than my Baofengs!

Yes, I got my Tech license 2 weeks ago. Spanking new license and call sign! I'm more of a creative arts and lit guy; learning tech stuff does NOT come easy or natural to me. I have to work at it. But I was born with an abundance of natural curiosity. I enjoy learning.  I'll be hitting the books studying for the General again this evening.
What part of the US are you aiming for in your plans to move?
Great resource for ham practice tests!  
https://www.qrz.com/hamtest/
We knew this was coming‚Äî- and all violent acts involving a weapon would be used as an opportunity to push gun control. They‚Äôll start w/ banning ‚Äúassault rifles‚Äù and  move to registration of existing ones. Failure to register will be a felony‚Äî- but
for the most part unenforceable. If homes are searched it‚Äôll be for another reason or becaue
because someone informed on you. At that point you‚Äôd be arrested (if you‚Äôre at home) and all of your weapons confiscated.
Yes. It‚Äôs only going to get worse. 
Tests have never been my strong suit. The Army's old 7Ps "propper prior planning prevents piss poor performance". Thanks for the study resources.
Good evening. I did a little bit of gambling today - which I do once a year on an "unknown" weapon system - and picked up a Toros Copolla T4.  For those who have not seen this before, it is basically a Turkish copy of the Benelli M4. The good news about it: the manufacturer claims 100% compatibility will all Benelli M4 OEM and aftermarket parts. After the factory-recommended 25 round brake in with buckshot or slugs, I will be running it this weekend next to a real Benelli and we are going to see how a $795.00 clone compares to the real deal. I can say this: I have already field stripped it per a Benelli M4 manual I was able to get online and - so far - I am seeing no discernable difference between this thing and the real Benelli M4 except: (a) the furniture is cosmetically different but appears functional (I have not removed to stock to check for compatibility with a telescoping M4 stock); (2) the
shell lifter is black instead of silver (I do not consider this a major drawback because I buy the welded lifters for all my Benelli shotguns anyway); (3) the trigger itself, although it appears to be of the same design, is a bit wider than what you find on a real Benelli; (5) the cocking handle appears smaller than a stock Benelli (although this is something I would replace with an oversized version anyway).
Now, if the markings on the gun had been obliterated and I tore this gun apart, I can see no difference between this and an M4. They APPEAR identical. The only disappointments thusfar are the the finish of the Benelli was cleaner (edges were more rounded, clearly different type of paint on a real Benelli) and the magazine tube seemed loose on the Turkish model. Nothing a drop or two of blue loctite won't fix and I am willing to give Toros the benefit of the doubt - for not - since many M4 owners replace the entire magazine tube (and the lack of loctite on the stock gun makes that easier).
Of course, what I have seen so far means nothing: On Saturday, we will see how it shoots and we will have a real Benelli to compare
I just thought if any of you were shotgun enthusiasts (as I am) that this would be an interesting blurb.
I don‚Äôt know anyone that would just hand them over willingly. Pretty sure this would be how you say, the straw that broke the camels back. 
I think it will eventually move in the direction of mandatory buybacks when they realize that an assault weapon ban doesn't work.  Are mass shootings committed with an AR-15?  Yes.  Once people can no longer acquire an AR-15, they will switch to pump action shotguns (including the new magazine fed pump actions) and we will also start seeing magazine fed lever actions - and the process will continue. While lever actions may seem like 19th century technology, imagine what a bad guy could do if someone created a lever action in 5.56mm that utilized a detachable 30 round magazine? Or when we start seeing 20 round drums for shotguns like the Mossberg 590M.  The results would be equally devastating - if not more so (imagine 20 rounds of buck shot at close range).
Frankly, a bad guy with an AR-15 is not what scares me. What will scare me is when we start seeing bad guys with bolt action rifles who know how to use them.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=URPEUqzDf5hp2M1W6) Here we go again!
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=areuPDfvdPkhk68YG) True!
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=YEfARXo9uLheHnRB7) Interesting analysis. Yes, its a continual game of forcing new innovations in the arms industry to find work arounds to the never-ending 2A infringements. We may even have to go back to flintlock muskets! But I would gladly carry a Mossberg with 20-round drums into battle with me, but HR 172 will make it near-impossible to purchase any gun. Hopefully, we'll have a thriving underground gun market. I  also think we'll see the massive expansion of the accessibility and use of 3D printers, which are starting to yield high-quality, serviceable weapons. It would be tough for them to come up with laws against plastic and software. At any rate, we need to just keep not complying with the radically unconstitutional 2A "laws."
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=ejZbHvK4RmsE5N6Ru) Totally agree (and paper ballots). I think I'm in love!

Please advise on CA SOPs for an Ops/Com plan or training.
Haha, there will be no more free elections after HR1. We will have become a banana republic
My wife, who is Russian, had rifle training in high school. Also had to throw a grenade a certain distance. It was during the Cold War.
Just got back to the computer after getting the kids to school. We are looking at moving to Michigan which is my home state and getting involved to help stop the madness. Micorwave/wifi is not as hard as most folks think and can be rather easy to set up with proper pre-planning. Will get a link to the business page for the antenna once up. For OK members I will figure out a way for folks to get the data from me at no cost. Printed, I have to charge what it costs me to produce and post.
Morning Georgia
Good morning all! Keep the faith! Stay strong Our Republic needs us!
Good Morning! What happened, everyone ghosted?

Good morning Pennsylvania!

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=P2SgNmHNZ5QqXQpQX) I already placed my order for a Ghost Gunner 3. What are they going to do? Outlaw blocks of aluminum?
Good morning or I should say good afternoon in your time zone. There are so many field expedient antennas out there. What fundamental type are you working with, single wire end fed, ladder line, dipole, folded dipole, J Pole, etc? Is it a multi-band and what frequency range does it cover?
Good morning OK sparkies.
This is a dipole meant for wide band. One is single band only and the other is able to be built into a dual band dipole. Designed for wide band usage. As with the 70cm it is possible to get the entire band under 1.4 SWR which is the intent as many antennas are limited in band width which limits what part of a band that a radio can use well.
The element section is based on 10mm dia aluminum tubing. Which gives a nice wide band from 23 cm up to about 10m before it start to truly narrow in the amount of band width it covers. Which gives the operator a much better options in how the antenna can be used.
Design to be an easily deployable unit that is also able to be permanently mounted in a location and withstand weather for extended periods of time.
Yes...kind of have
Keeping.AZ, You have me looking deeper into the digital / analog HTs. I fell a sleep reading about the differences between DMR vs NXDN.
yes I agree
23cm to 10m is a huge swath
Each band not as a single antenna
One model can do dual band but not all of them.
How big is it at 23cm and how big at 10m
You have a weather resistant central until that you have a strain relief built into that is set up for 28mm PEX or other 28mm OD tube from there you have two elements that are tuned to ONE band
In your opinion wich digital mode is the one to go for, DMR or NXDN?
the version with 23cm arms is the full band width. The version with the 10m arms is still being refined as I am looking at either clip on ferrites as I use with it for 23cm to 6m or going over to a proper toroid as there is room in the housing for one.
DMR is more common.
Also you can break the rules a bit easier with DMR if that is needed.
Cool thanks
Encryption is easier to set up and also to change. Again that is NOT any official state from anyone but me.
I watched an interesting YouTube clip on a fan-dipole and how the different bands seek and utilize the most appropriate sections of the antenna, much like seeking the path of least resistance.
Yep, it is how a dual band dipole works
Have you covered your design with a patent application?
No, it is not unique enough to be able to get a patent.
That is $400 that would be wasted as the patent would most likely be refused.
I got you there.
Though it doesn't infringe on any patent either, so it is one of those issues of the unique design type would aid it in trying for a patent but the fact the other types similar exist via other manufacturing system means that the patent could not be defended in court.
Maybe a utility or design patent, not that I'm trying to spend your money
Something to look into. It's always nice to have some type of protection if profit is your goal
True, I make a product that I need to patent even though the original design that I have seriously improved on was abandoned by the original designer. The sad thing is that the original designer still claims that he has a patent.
Which he doesn't, I checked. Which if push comes to shove would put him in a bad place as the fed's don't like folks claiming patents they don't actually own.
Patents run out in 7 years as far as I know. But I am not an attorney.
The patent system is sort of a catch 22. it helps protect you to an extent IF you have the resources to fight infringement cases in court. Yet it also gives those who will pirate it enough information to duplicate it.
That is very true
Depending on type 25 years unless they changed it again.
I see
The Chinese are well known for issuing patents on item that are either already patented some were else or are public domain due to the patent running out or the item not being patentable (within the 15% of variation rule).
Don't kow
If you don't mind me asking, how'd you end up in Australia
I am in the UK. I don't mind as I have dealt with that type of issue here from way back. Water off a ducks back.
Good morning Patriots!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
I inherited dual citizenship from my great grandparents that I did not know about during my time in service. I have friends that would love for me to be in Oz.
It's on the bucket list for sure
What is your service background
TDMA vs. FDMA... now you're talking my language
Military Police and Engineer. Two separate tours. USAR
My first unit is no longer part of the command it was in when I was there. It was deactivated and then re-activated on the West coast.
I first went in the Army in 81, served 6 and then after 911 that patriotic bug in my head had me signing back up again. Thought I could do my part locally in a NG outfit but 6 months in we were deployed in the first part of OIF. I ended up on Tallil airbase 120 miles south of Bagdad. Hot ass desert.
I was on MP duty at Camp Perry during the national rifle matches when Kuwait went hot. We started placing bets on when we would be deployed. Ended up never going even though volunteered twice.
Funny how things work out. Desert Storm was a short one. Over in a blink.
During the 80's there were a lot like that. Grenada, Panama, the Libya stand off.
Yes. I was in Germany during the disco tech bombing.
Heard of it but don't anything that went on with it.
I was on Panzer Kasern, Rommel's headquarters. Security was high after that and we actually found a bomb planted in a trash barrel between the officers quarters and the day cay both of which were just off base. We dodged a big one there
Yeah the communists of that time were rather direct in their actions.
The modern global socialists (Gozi's) have learned from the mistakes of time and are being a bit more careful in how they start this one off.
This is the day of PsyOp's and very few folks really understand how to deal with them.
This seems to have been in the works for some time. And no doubt in my mind that the vid was purposefully deployed to get Trump out. And the level of deep state corruption at every level to include the courts is a cancer so deep that I don't know how we will overcome it
That depends on how we deal with it.
Have you ever read the book "Tactics of Mistake"?
No but I will
It is fiction but the ideas are sound.
Right now the need is to keep legal pressure on the government and also work on exposing corrupt judges to such a degree that they can't remain on the bench.
Also getting involved in local election polling and getting registered as a independent pollster for elections. I don't care if you hold to a party don't carry their card.
I went independent long ago
As more and more states are passing laws to require independent poll workers of a certain percentage. The Socialists are using this to get their people in as independent persons.
That way you can run for a county elector seat and also as a poll worker.
This will help stop part of the problem and also aid in getting the evidence to show the corruption.
When Roberts got away with rewriting obamacare making the penalty a tax so he could vote for it, that was the beginning of the shitstorm
As they are not going to stop, they want power and control and they are full of hate.
No the shit storm started way back with LBJ. Roberts was only a chapter of it.
Does that makes sense??
This whole thing is a long game, this is not anything new. Obama was the regional organizer for ACORN before he ran for senate. Wonder HOW he beat the incumbent even when he was looking to be under investigation?
To win this as I wrote in a few other spots we need to get folks together and build bridges. We need to file lawsuits and do so that judges don't want to dismiss them as they will stink of corruption.
The biggest issue is not giving Biden an election he did not legally win.
The way to do that is by having enough states do recounts and declare the vote to be a fraud and invalid. Which then puts Biden and Co in the position of either showing their true colors and then things get interesting or in backing down and trying to find a way that they will use the media to justify him staying in office.
As he is not the office holder they want in office.
This is not a little thing and really requires someone to be a HQ for it and work with those who are trying to stop the steal but it is not going to be easy.
Most likely a small team for national and one for each state that is going to be used as a hot bed.
Too many folks are shrugging their shoulders and got the oh well we tried defeat mentality.
I read an article the other day that said HCs lawyers were involved in all of the battleground state election law changes. It said that cammel can't be president because she wasn't born in the US or buy US citizens at time of her berth. The point was that they are planning on putting HC in bidens place
That is going to be interesting as her is not legally in any position that is part of the legal succession for the President.
There is a lot of false flags flying right now. There are many version of Q out there and many don't even know that they are being played.
I think the congress can make an appointment under certain circumstances
Only from a select group of persons.
Ford was Speaker of the House, when he took over from the VP
Then again Obama was not actually legal to be president anyways, so that won't stop the dem's.
I can't answer that
Though 375 is an interesting number
Yes it is
Just the states that a legal challenge has a chance (PA is not one of those) you are looking at 64 electoral votes being taken from Biden. He doesn't have that to spare.
Which would then put his position in a difficult place and also force the issue that there was national election fraud. Which would put Mr and Mrs. FB in serious hot water as folks look for goats to throw under the bus.
At that point only would PA be able to be leveraged.
Which IF the case was won would jump it to 84 and then he is looking rather like the tin dictator he and the Dem's are.
All extremely valid
Yes now how do you get this to a group of people who are willing to put their lives on the line to get this done?
Knowing that they most likely will not get paid near enough to cover the costs of getting it done nor the costs those who will be needed to protect them and their families?
There is the gentleman from the pillow company and there is also others who are willing. The big issue is keeping them alive and also getting some folks who an get the data to keep the judges honest for fear of their sins coming out into the light.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=tE4mYwj3GySqgLfb2) Long live the Republic
The problem is the false flag of Q has gotten a lot of folks burned which is what it was meant to do. It was meant to create false hope and apathy. It did it well. Gladly give them a prize for very well done PsyOp just before I put them up against the wall.
I love ML. After the attempted takedown of his business I bought a box full of his bedding to support him
Good on you. Now we need to that for every farmer and all other local business that we can. That and stop buying anything from China.
But getting people to do more than just chat about this problem is tough
Stop using face book and youtube as much as possible.
Depends, when you point out that they are choosing to be slaves by not helping stop this and that the battle is not over even though the media is conditioning you to believe it is.
Like how many folks believe that 9/11 was done by Muslims still?
Why, they have been fed the lie for avery long time.
I still want to see the engines that were at the Pentagon.

Windy, interesting article. Most folks don't know that FDR was a socialist. That the KGB after the war intentionally spread the false information that the Nazi's were Fascists. Then again you have the very false information that the founding fathers of the US were masons which is an outright lie as the picture of Washington in masonic garb was done after his death and commissioned by a masonic hall that was central in putting forth the falsehood of the membership.

Then there is the bay of pigs, Tet, Crude oil being a fossil fuel or even coal for that matter. 9/11 and box knives? have you ver looked at a ox knife? building seven. Then WMD. The list goes on and on. Folks don't want to look as it gets really ugly and depressing fast. One must have a very sure view of oneself and willing to admit that we can be fooled to be able to look at honest research into the History of the World. Which is why real history is rarely taught these days.

Awesome comment, sir. I'm still learning about the full extent of the lies and deception we've been systemically fed, such as the examples you give. I always considered myself a pretty well-versed armchair historian until March, 2020 opened my eyes to the big picture you refer to here. I totally agree with you on the German National Socialist Workers Party (why did they have to go and put "socialist" in their party's name, though. Really?) getting a bad rap by the allies propaganda machine. And to tell you the truth, I've never cared, one way or another, whether the Founding Fathers were Freemasons. I just want to be able to live a life with at least my pre-2020 freedoms intact. Its clear to me now, that they aren't going to play with on that, so now I'm going to have to physically fight for them on the one ground where I thought I was safe...lol 
No, I have never heard of "ox knife" or "building seven." Can you please elaborate on that for me and/or give me a link with the info. Sounds like something I need to know. Thank you!

I also just reached out to a gun shop owner I know and it turns out that he was an OK founding member. He's just been so busy lately he kind of fell off the radar.

MOLON LABE! ---Keeping.AZ
box knife, sorry for typo and building seven is part of 9/11 look it up. Only building to do a complete straight down collapse from localized fires in parts of the structure.
Oops I forgot to attach the YouTube clip. http://brighteon.com/2580587c-75ee-4330-a022-dc6cfc513812
will watch later need to feed the kids and my turn to make dinner tonight.
Thanks for clarifying! Building seven, that's wild!
Digital is not the way to go for many reasons.  You want good reliable comms stick with FM.  At the moment I do not believe there are any FRS radios that do digital.  @Keeping.AZ radios are not licensed by the FCC.  They are type accepted or type certified.  It is a difference that is important.  Just because a radio is type accepted or type certified does not mean it is legal to use for a particular purpose without proper licensing.  I don't want folks to get confused on that point.
@jpj , we were talking about a digital ham HT radio. Not FRS.
When it comes to COMMS Signal To Noise Ratio performance is key if you are at the fringe of coverage.  For voice comms from best to worst the SNR is SSB -> FM -> Digital.
There is no commercial SSB VHF handheld made at this point, so best SNR comes from FM, and analog FM allows you to get partial messages through where as DMR sounds great until you get to the edge, then you fall off totally.
@jpj, what do you think about digital HT hams? As opposed to analog-only. Advantages/Disadvantages?
So you will get better range from FM and you will get warning you are getting out of range.
DMR is great in a situation where you are in a well defined area with SOLID DMR repeater coverage on a system designed to have plenty of margin.  That is the way Fire/Police/EMS digital systems are designed.  A first responder is not going to fall out of the digital coverage.
For us on ops where we are working portable to portable FM will serve better.
@jpj , if one has a ham HT that is digital DMR-capable, does that allow you to receive trunked digital signals?
While I agree with JPJ on the SNR  statement digital repeater or even digital simplex with a well placed antenna is going to get you a cleaner signal further. Now the down side is that once you hit a dead spot you will get little to nothing. I have been working with DMR repeaters in Scotland, mainly the greater Edinburgh area and you would be surprised at the range of a 2m digital signal with a well placed antenna for the base unit. The current DMR portable units and the fact that there is now portable repeaters for DMR (have helped with one of those they are neat and power effective).  tends to put the argument of the limits of DMR down a bit. The fact that you can also link that DMR to a MESHnet and increase the range that way is also a ppoint to be considered. Considering that 15Db horn antennas for 2.3 and 5.o Ghz can be printed and then either sanded or coated in epoxy paint to give a very smooth surface for transmission. The down side on the upper end of VHF and getting into XHF is the amount of sensitivity to any form of motion in the antenna. It is why on ALL of our deployable mast MESHnet units we go with a simple panle antenna for the 2.3 and 5.0 Ghz as anything else requires rather significant bracing currently. We are working on improving that. We = RAYNET Lothians. As being a volunteer group that is NOT funded by the government in any way but expected to ba able to support multiple functions during emergrncies we have to get creative in design and ability to deploy.
A mix of ability is best but does put a strain on the end user. Which has been a problem that Comm's has been dealing with here since I first was a member back in 2013. While we encourage folks to improve their skills and get HAM certified, we also have to deal with some folks only currently really having either FRS or CB Comm's or worse yet only their smart phone (Zello can used for that but it is not a good match). There is no easy solution.
@Keeping.AZ Trunking is a different capability.  Nope having a digital HT does not mean you can follow trunking jumps.
Is it then worth having analog/DMR HT combos?
@ssgtgman If you are a HAM, and you live in an area with good DMR repeater systems then yes if you want to spend the money for a dual mode radio.
JPJ, yes and no. Depends on what other equipment is involved. Adding a hotspot or a mini repeater that doesn't require NOV (less than 1W in UK, I don't know US reg's) you can access trunk via any computer that has internet or MESHnet type access. the AnyTone AT-D868 UV and 878 both have reasonable FM on their analog and good battery life while also adding DMR. I use them so I am biased. I also use an Icom IC-T8E and while it is really good in three bands for analog it eats batteries like candy and really needs to be run from a 12V power supply to get the best out of it. Some of the combos are not worth it. Though the GD-77 has some open source firm ware that allow it to become a heavy duty hotspot that easily hands the wattage of a normal HT while also connecting to a computer and the available trunking features that allows.
@chiroeurope for most OK ops in the states most of our needs for comms on the ground will be with folks that are not hams.
Correct at which time we are dealing with FRS or CB.
Which is were a node point is actually useful as you can create cross band comm's legally via a couple of raspberry pi 3b
Thank you jpj!  :relaxed:
That or purchasing a commercial permit, though that has it's own issues.
@chiroeurope sadly in the USA repeater coordinating bodies have not set aside any channels for itinarant repeaters.  This can be an issue trying to set up any system on the fly in response to a situation.
Well I'm 4 hours north of you jpj. Probably be somewhere in New England, Connecticut or NH if I move. What is the digital repeater array like in New England?
That sucks
jpj...just tried it but it won't take me to Pennsylvania like it used to
Here we share 70cm with MoD and they are willing to set certain groups aside for emergencies, as it just makes sense.
Uncorordinated repeaters, digital or analog, can subject the licensee who's call sign they are operating under to fines or license suspension if interference is complained of by a coordinated repeater.
Are the bands that crowded that you can't stay 12.5Khz off of a licensed repeater and 1W is going have a hard time with a 5W unit near by.
1W  being the limit in the UK on personal repeaters.
@ssgtgman you can find the state of repeaters at some of the online repeater directories, but be warned many repeaters are listed that have gone off the air.  In NYC I have nearly 50 repeaters in my HTs that used to be operational and are still listed, but in practice there are about 5 operational repeaters in NYC at this time.
Though they will allow an EIRP of up to 3W depending on antenna used.
Repeater regs are different here Doc.  Somewhat more complex.
jpj MM0MSU here have you been on world check in or TG2355? I know about six of the serious folks in NYC and they are all stating the same thing that NYC is near dead on repeaters.
Here in Scotland we have gone from three for all of Scotland (including the Northern Isles) to four just in Edinburgh alone.
Yep and I can not put one up because all the slots are given out, but the repeaters are not operational.  Hell I know one guy personally that has a 2M and 70CM pair.  Were widely used repeaters.  He shut them down when covid hit because the area they were in turned into a war zone and he pulled them to keep from losing his equipment.
I doubt they will ever go back up.
What is an American Chiro doing in the land of Hagus?
We also have a few student groups operating pirate repeaters on analog and DMR. Trying to shut them down as it is causing grief ofr the rest of us with OfComm refusing to deal with commercial abuse and other pirate radio.

Long story, got here from Italy and working on moving back to the US. By the way it is Haggis, and that is the singular and the pural.
What do you guys think about WiRES-X?
Write now trying to stay alive after cancer treatment that made me allergic to rapeseed (canola for folks in the US) and a national crop here.
Over hyped and not the best
Wires-X is nice but they really have not supported it and with the cross mode repeaters going up it is not worth going into at present.
Born and raised in Iowa but now residing in Minnesota, popping in to say hi to my old stomping grounds.
Oh and if anyone wants haggis I know how to get it legally shipped to the US. Also right now the government has a loop hole on single malt Whisky.
My kids love haggis, Neeps, and Tatties.
Sorry to hear about the big "C". Lost my younger brother last year to 3 brain tumors
@chiroeurope , you said "cross mode." Did you mean cross band?
LOVE haggis...just can't get true haggis in US.  HOW?!?
Lost my thyroid and the surgeon also took out two of the parathyroids and you don't have malpractice courts in the UK that have any real power.
Love good single malt, but have no money.  No he means cross mode....like analog to DMR or WIRES to Echolink.
No I mean cross mode, D-star, DMR, NXDN, Wires-X, A-Star
WIRES allows for auto connect of a WIRES equipped repeater to another WIRES equipped repeater via the internet.
Thanks JPJ
So, repeaters are moving toward cross mode? Analog Rx to digital Tx?
JPJ have you ever had Glen Moray??
I have a wires button on 2 radios.  I have tried programming it to make use of WIRES listed repeaters both in NYC and while traveling.  No joy.  WIRES is proprietory to Yaesu which is why there has not been universal adoption.
Not all and mostly the digital not the analog
No I have not Doc.
It is good. Our house swill.
I need to go to feed the troops, will be back later.
In the USA you still have analog FM as the dominant repeater system.  Some have moved to Analog/DMR, my own club has one.  Others just run in Analog mode and allow DMR to use it to repeat themselves.  If you are cash strapped and you have gotten your license get a good quality Analog FM radio.
If you are not cash strapped start looking at digital/analog combo radios, but know there are multiple digital formats and they are not compatible.
@jpj , your opinion of the Yaesu FT3DR?
Yaesu makes good solid kit.  I have a yaesu from 1974 that was in service until 2 months ago when a cap failed.  Have the replacement part and will repair it when I get to the cabin next.
Have multiple Yaesu radios ranging from 1974 vintage to current models.
The FT3DR looks like the beginning of a new gen of HTs.
VX-5, VX-7, and VX-8 handhelds are all touch solid reliable and have good rx, so I expect the FT3DR will also be good.
...color touch screens, much like smart phones.
2 of my 3 marine VHF radios are Vertex Standard (Yaesu) and both of my airband radios are Vertex Standard.
They make good kit.
They did have a combo Aircraft/Ham HT that was a bust due to having a dirty transmitter.  They pulled it off the market pretty fast.
I have a dirty transmitter too. Luckily I shower every morning.

Yes, this is a "Copy and Paste" response but only because I feel each of you need to be thanked for your kind words, thoughts, prayers, ideas and questions about how you can help. Due to my current security posture, my Girlfriend and I have been mobile and limiting our use of any electronics. As many of you will understand, the Special Forces Mind works in "Most Likely" and "Most Dangerous" Courses of Actions. While it is "Most Likely" Federal Law Enforcement will simply ignore my speaking out in hopes the Media will allow it to fade away with little to no damage (common tactic), the "Most Dangerous" is that they expedite any case development and move quickly to detain and hold me without bail like many of the men and women I worked alongside of in January who are being held as "Political Prisoners". It is my strategy and Evasion Plan if Action (EPA) to make their jobs AS HARD AS POSSIBLE. Like the line goes, "I have a special set of skills..."

Therefore, I WILL respond to everyone I can as soon as I can, so please be patient with me. Hundreds of you have reached out and I am greatly encouraged. Many have offered skills, help, money, advice and many other things. I will continue to put together a plan to take on these evil clowns, but don't wait for me. BE the one in your neighborhoods, communities, town and cities to stand up and LEAD. Start small. Next door, then your street, then a few blocks. You will be surprised what can be achieved at a "Pot Luck Block Party". We have to band together yesterday, for if "we don't hang together we will most assuredly hang SEPARATELY!"

Tomorrow (Thursday March 24th) I will be LIVE on "The American Journal" with Harrison Smith at 11am EST/10am CST on Banned.Video . Please tune in or watch later. I will be on 3 other shows soon and getting more invites everyday. Share with anyone you can, but keep this in mind: Videos and Social Media will NEVER be better than Real Human Contact with other Americans. These are TOOLS, but WE the PEOPLE are the WEAPONS the Tyrants FEAR most! Liberty and Freedom have NEVER been won with talking or voting, it has ALWAYS been WON by Men and Women standing up and pushing back! "Evil ONLY prospers when GOOD Men do NOTHING", so if not US, then WHO? If not NOW, then WHEN?

Again, thank you to EVERYONE and I will be speaking to you all again soon. Be safe, but NOT at to cost of your LIBERTY!

Jeremy gave out his email in his interview with Brandon Gray. For those of you who didn't catch it and would like to reach out to him it is; ggsol@protonmail.com
@Keeping.AZ yes that was Kellye with SR.
@ssgtgman if you have a secure communications channel with him tell him he needs to publish his gpg public key to the keyservers or on his own web page if he has one.  It will be best if he can get it signed by someone well known in the community, but if not it should at least be published so people can have secure email with him.
Something to pass on to folks that do not understand antifa.

jpj he gave out his protonmail email near the end of the video of his interview. I posted it above but here it is again. ggsol@protonmail.com

jpj, FYI Jeremy Brown stated that he is a fellow OK If that helps you reaching out to him. His email may be a bit overloaded after giving it out in that interview.
only way to put frs on a meter is to void the warantee
no antenna conector.  have to open up and break wire to antenna
I am just concerned folks use secure comms 
I forgot about that. Too bad it can't be done like with an amp clamp type tester. Also what about calling into a ham radio with a power meter and checking that way?
protonmail is supposed to be pretty safe in the scope of email servers.
sure as long as you only email other proton users

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=h8BC7ClxbRVtw2KFj) Biden has lost control of the border crisis and doesn't seem to be too concerned about it; yet he also has no problem with flagrantly violating freedom of the press (wouldn't this be a clearly  impeachable offense?). I believe this is all a ploy they will use it to say that its time for us to have open borders, create chaos and further expedite the fall of the Republic. This represents an imminent threat to our national security! I wonder how much longer Americans will be willing to look the other way, in return for hollow promises of endless government freebies and UBI? Plus, getting a pass for never again having to think again for themselves, as they know they can trust Big Brother is happy to make all their decisions for them. I'm sure the waves of illegals laying siege to our border are hoping for the same thing. As well as the expectation of immediately being granted citizenship. I've got a sneaking feeling they won't have to wait too long, as the damage from their forced jab campaign begins to kick in over the nest few months. This, combined with their imminent cancellation of our Second Amendment, this has quickly devolved into a worst-case scenario.
Either way I'm not concerned about the warranty. Finding good frs units for the troops is more important. I actually ordered two different sets by mistake. I was looking at two different models had them in my cart along with a 7 band RX 2 band TX HT. Then my wife pulled into the driveway and I hastily deleted what I thought was one of the frs pairs and placed the order but I instead deleted the multi band HT by mistake. So if your up for it I have two sets of frs units both brands claiming 2 watts. I can send you one of each or all four for testing. May turn out to be valuable info to pass on good bad or mediocre? Entirely up to you, let me know. Might be cool to have a go at building a clamp type watt meter that could test antennas while on the radio.
F the media blackout. We should have video drones down there live streaming to gab etc.
It's the US he can't order media blackouts on our own soil. That shit is for overseas conflicts.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=j3bdAafqbjZRYhbiQ) Yes we should. The NWO is executing their plan, unopposed, with discipline and precision. Just like taking candy from a baby
Who do we have in that neck of the woods? The big dog is in Texas there must be a group of heavy hitters in that area that could get the job done.
Thanks for the intel windy, It's 2:45am here I have get a few zzz's in. Keep up the good work.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=PcpGKQn2SWHWPfuW6) I do hope so, Staff Sergeant. This is BIG. I live in SE Colorado, only a 4-5 hour drive to West Texas. If I had the full support for it from leadership on it, I would volunteer go down there as part of  an OK recon team, and get as close to the main crossing points, to find out what they are doing that they don't want us to know about. We definitely need to connect with our TX members on it first, but I don't know any of them. I've heard various reports that CBP have started busing them to small towns in AZ, and dumping them off on those communities with no warning, and also flying them to unspecified states along the Canadian border. Very strange. If this continues unchecked, they will be running rampant all across the country causing major havoc.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=bj29e9XS6e8fjMgSB) Thank you, Staff Sergeant. Always. Holding down the fort for you here in Wild West. Rest well.

Good morning Texas from McLennan County as well
Thanks, @windy !  The town is Gila Bend (HEE-LAH bend) 45min south of Phoenix metro.
*Buffalo Jump*```

```
```
Charlottesville was a buffalo jump; the federal Capitol was a larger, more significant one. The Right were the buffalo, the media and courts were the cliff, the Judeo-Bolsheviks were the Injuns. Seems the Right never learns. The Judeo-Bolsheviks dance rings around the Right when it comes to the media. The media ain't on our side. We need our own. Where are the Dissident Right billionaires who yearn to own television networks and movie studios?

Secondly, our side needs to act as though they know they have a spine. Stop apologizing. An eighteenth century British PM, Disraeli, had it nailed: never apologize, never explain.

If you'd be ashamed to have your grandfather hear of what you are doing, don't do it. If you're proud of what you're doing then stop groveling and apologizing to the adversary. That includes if you get busted. Consider yourself a political prisoner. Don't grovel, don't apologize.
```
That was sent to me by someone not in OK.
Not sure if the term Judeo-Bolsheviks would be what I would use, but I think he makes the point.
chiroeurope, Did you get through that YouTube clip on Benghazi, the CIA, & Binladin?
Not yet as been ill today, just now really getting to get work going and still not feeling fully right.
What is interesting is they are not talking about the C130 gunship that was in location to give support and was told to stand down after the General was removed from command position.
The information being given out is incomplete and strangely so. As if to muddy the water.
There was a snatch team in both Sicily and Puglia that could have been there within a two hour time period. There was a C130 gunship on stand by for support, there were two wings of strike fighters at the US air force base in Italy that were hot on the runway. These are items that seem to be getting left out of the bigger picture.
Yes they mention all of this
Then again the US doesn't like drawing attention to the Nuclear sub base in Sicily, nor the NATO intel hub in Southern Italy.
Must have missed it
Sadly there is no such thing as a clamp on watt meter.  All I can test for is frequency accuracy and stability, rx sensitivity, rx out of band rejection (really important) and near field field strength.  Near field field strength is a factor of 2 things, antenna and power out.
To cut through all of the personal stuff in the clip I posted two time stamps to jump to
Are you near NYC?
missed the first one will go back to it.
They talked about several assets that were available and that NATO offered to give support but it was turned down. The secret CIA extension, clinton and biden wanted them dead
Good morning Patriots!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Sorry for the short reply last night.  Was on my phone and do not do the phone type thing well.
No problem it was getting late anyway thought you might be hitting the pillow.
That is why on the phone
I'm in Boston. Our youngest son lives in NYC and youngest daughter and son in law are now back and forth from their new home in Connecticut and there NYC apartment and business. So I could come down or male them.
I found the edit function yesterday
Actually NATO was kept in the dark for the most part, until things were going very bad. Italy and Malta offered and towards the end, the French also offered but they were turned down or not given data that could have helped. NATO itself did not directly offer aid. Which is one of the things that is now being used as an excuse for why the US did not use the resources that were in place. The mission had to fail as the missiles had to be destroyed and those who knew what was going on behind it had to be dealt with. The ambassador might actually have been part of the issue, this is unknown. The support team was not from what info there is but they did know that thing were not right two days before hand when two of their support resources got moved to another station position with a rather flimsy excuse for why it was moved. Most of this information came out in Italian papers, as Italy had and has no love of Obama nor of Biden.
The question then arise why parts are being fed to the public in a disjointed fashion. Part is due to how the information is being uncovered and part is from reasons that I don't know. As it doesn't completely flow in a logical pattern nor does the data fully match.
It is like building seven. Which is an interesting part of a puzzle that was not what most folks believe.
Then again most folks think that the Bush's were actual conservative politicians. Not realizing that the family is a long standing member of some of the more progressive groups in government going back to before the Senator.
towards the end is the typo I did sorry.
Did you catch the part about the CIA offshoot that has gone rogue and was behind all of this. Also they said binladin was not killed, it was a double.
Speaking of typos, I found how to edit here
Oh yes that is old knowledge. Safari Club was a wierd group that still exists under different names. They were the ones involved with Col Oliver North and a lot of the CIA drug runing from the 60's forward.
You can edit typo's here?
Example, watch as I fix; the boat is sinking
Found it
Thank you
Question for you on frs. How to check wattage output without opening up unit (fixed antenna).
The sad thing is how many Americans who on one hand know that 9/11 was not what it seems and yet still accept the blame the Muslim  chant. Which to a degree the Iranian government and part of the Saudi families deserve, but they are not the part that folks don't want to deal with.
How true
Do you know anyone with a frequency detector? As that will let you know the wattage of the signal on the better units.
I was thinking that calling into a HAM radio with a S meter would give some idea
No plane hit the Pentagon, I am pretty sure it was not the planes that were listed that hit the twin towers as one of them was still flying three years latter (tail numbers are unique to each aircraft). I sure as heck know that no aircraft went down in the fields of PA, I don't know did happen there. Also cell phone ability was not in major aircraft until 5 years after 9/11 and BA was the first carrier to offer it.
That would to a degree yes.
Happy to road trip to Boston at some point.  If you can go to downtown Boston with the radios and a helper it will be easy to do a good field test.  Downtown Boston is almost as RF polluted as NYC.  Set the radios to one of the 2 watt channels (some channels are 1/2 watt max) and see what sort of distance you get out of them straight line.  Meaning start back to back and walk opposite directions on the same straight street so you have no obstructions.
Then do the same test in the suburbs and see what distance you get.
Then there are the multiple secondary explosions in both towers and building 7 and the liquid metal 36 hours after the attack that happened. All of which point to some rather ugly hanky panky going on.
That will tell much about how good the receiver is.  A good receiver will reject the out of band signals and not be desensitized by them.
Make sure you are set for carrier squelch (no so called privacy codes or tones).
Then Benghazi, Las Vegas, and the list gets long. Very very long.
I was thinking if we could design a swr watt meter that, say used a toroid like a clip on amp meter that is designed to read without being in the line.
If you get the same distance in both tests then the radios have good RX.  Since you have 2 different types each person takes one of each and you try them both at each point you stop at for a test.
Simple practical and no outside test equipment needed.
I'm game
Good morning from Sweet Home Alabama. There's strength in numbers and we are the majority in population and tax payers so we rule if we wish.
Might be another revenue stream if it can be done. With the new FCC regs on permanent antennas there is a market for such a tester
I'm retired so other than a VA appointment every once in a while I'm available most any time.
Looking ti up and will look through the manual on antennas that I have.
KAZ, I meant to ask. You just got your technicians license, did you take the test online?
It is done sort of with direction finding equipment. Would just have to be refined to be able to detect for the wattage that is being transmitted.
Well keep me in the loop.
Will do, the circuits are not my strong suit.
I was thinking you could bring your old school frs units for a baseline comparison
I still wonder how folks can believe an out of shape man can get up and run 45 feet lay back down and acquire a target area in less than 35 seconds. While having to go around to pieces of furniture in the process.
That the fed's being onsite at the time of the shooting is not just a bit strange.
I expect they will not go as far just because they are 1/4 the power.  That does not mean 1/4 the distance, but it will not be as good as the 2 watts.
Or that they dug up the whole crime scene to 5 feet deep to stop any evidence from remaining on site. Which a 5.56 will not penetrate that deep into the under layer of asphalt, but a 7.62 will.
On the same idea but a different thought. I was thinking of designing a antenna that could sit over fixed antenna that would give you either a coax feed to connect whatever antenna you like or just a better stick antenna.
That is difficult as you will lose a lot of power with the coupling.
There that dealt with
I hear you on the feds thing. I believe the government is setting these attacks in motion to push for gun confiscation
Staying within the rules is something we need to do as long as possible but we also need to understand that it might not always be wise or possible to do that.
Have been since Bonnie and Clyde
On the power loss, like having a multi-band stick with a big coil on the base for low frequency, they eat up power.
This is why doing everything we can to build bridges with multiple other groups and aid them were able will help down the road to a great extent. It is why SR has us involved as much as possible in emergency relief efforts. Folks remember who was there when their back was to the wall.
I added two more notches to my Wiki belt. FIVE more to go!
No, I took the test in person.
It is why the fed's leave the cajun navy alone even though they have stopped the ability of fed's from going into property without warrants to seize items of interest or to look for firearms to take. This has been an issue in the south since Bush was in office.
It was  nice meeting local hams.
Bush Sr., though there is data that puts it back much much further than that.
Afternoon here.
Afternoon patriot
Yes so many RINOs in our midst
Has been for over 100 yrs as the movement to undo much of the Republic is something that has been going on for a very long time. Some would say from the time it was founded as it dared to give the individual the right to chose how they would live their life within the understanding of respecting others to have that same right.

Oh cool. I thought due to the vid that it was online. Any chance it's open book?
Not open book. But it's not timed either.
Sad that they want to tare it down
So no notes then either. Oh boy
I'll let you know when they hit my door step and we can set something up.
Power and hate. That is what drives them. Hate of others and hate of God. The firm belief that they have the right to rule by might and that the ends justify the means.
The Tech license has 35 questions pulled from a bank of 450 possible questions. All 450 questions and answers are online. Read, study, memorize, and take lots of practice tests on QRZ.com.
I had plans to take the General this Saturday, but I'm going to hold off and put in another week of study and practice.
This forum is quieter than it was before the deplat. I suspect there are 2 reasons...
1)  Members new and old are frustrated by lack of leadership at state and national level.
2)  DOJ's Nazi crackdown campaign on OKers since Jan 6, has effectively forced many OKers underground.
@jpj  How are things looking at the national level? Is it coming together?
I've heard you can take them both one after the other if you are ready? I'd like that. Do you know how many questions are in the general?
Sad but true
Biden is doing a press conference at 1300 EDT.
@stewart-rhodes is pulling things together, but national is really busy with the lawsuit and with trying to keep on top of what is going on with the political prisoners.
If you have Signal or Threema, message me there at 406-291-6558.   If you don‚Äôt, then just text me at that number.  I prefer to do Signal or Threema calls.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=4fG2zTnEASpp7MsPx) I think you're right! Where does that leave us? A network of lone wolves? Being underground in this situation isn't a promising sign when action is needed. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals yesterday effectively cancelled the Second Amendment (now no right to open carry over the entire West Coast, Alaska and Hawaii, and headed to the Supreme Court where it will likely be confirmed as the law of the land). The Colorado chat has been dead and I see nothing but fear and resignation here on the ground in Colorado. The little bit of "resistance" I've seen here is a group in Denver that is essentially doing patriot bake sales. Other than that, Denver is now basically the Borg. The economy here is trashed, 90%d are still wearing masks and lining up for the vax. I realize this has been a psychological war to this point, but if that 9th Circuit 2A decision is confirmed in SCOTUS, its going to go kinetic fast!
By the way Discord is rather foolish as I have my account back with them on the same email that they removed for being a part of OK.
Also it has taken a bit for the chat group to get back up and running and that delay can lose a few folks as well.
Anyone idea what he plans on doing at this press conference?
Considering he is currently following the script that the socialists used in the UK when they went after everyone's guns.
Actually a lot less then 90% are lining up for the drug but the media won't tell you that.
In the UK they have been counting all offers of the drug that are refused as a positive dosage. Which an outright lie but that is the government here for you and I bet sections of the US are doing the same.
Discord right now has it's own issues as it has been caught being a platform for Pedo's and for drug smuggling.
I can confirm the discord part. I've outed way too many people in the last couple months and ended up just getting yelled at for it. 
Do I need to download rocket chat for this or if I want to access it on my phone?
Second Update for Thursday, March 25th:  Latest update: There will be 3 Constitutional Carry Bills on the agenda - HB 1238, HB 1911, and HB 2900. (HB 1927 is being withdrawn to start to focus more narrowly on what is expected to move forward.)

As always - subject to change!

Also: HB 1911 has a committee substitute that is very good and makes it a much stronger bill, very similar to HB 1238 & HB 2900.
OK, so WHAT if anything are we all doing in OUR locals?  ANYTHING?  Recruiting? Meetings? Educational Classes? Preparing for whatever?
In the meantime, TEXAS!  Are we recruiting? meeting? training? educating our friends and neighbors? Are we doing ANYTHING constructive, or just sitting around doing nothing?
we have a problem with oath breaker judges
I mean, I'm always preparing
I've pm'd a couple with idea of meeting locally to get to know each other in not too distant future.  I have to be a little careful as I'm recovering from chemotherapy at this time.  Studying my HAM radio books so I can take that test in near future.
Working on moving back to the US and talking with folks in Michigan on how to bring lawsuits against sections of the government for violation of election law as well as other felonies. That and finding Judges that will let cases go forward. Which unfortunately is not as easy as it should be.
I‚Äôm in Freestone Co. Have a good deal of preps. Food, water, etc. I am 66 years young but will do what I can to help. 
you and cowboyfanatic so far are fairly close to me.  I live outside of Eddy  when cowboyfanatic answers my pm we can maybe look at meeting somewhere in the middle just to get acquainted.  Like you :-) I have enough years behind me that I'm not jumping into the frying pan with people I don't know, so it's important to know each other somewhat.  I also am not going to be any Rambo as I'm a cancer patient going through treatment, but still love my Country and will do what I can
judges assigned at random where there is more than one
Wished that was the case and that is what should be the case but there is currently evidence of certain cases in areas of Michigan being sent to Judges that will block even discovery from happening with no legal grounds for doing so.
I am not there so this is second hand data but it is from a lawyer on one of the cases.
Though the young APP political movement is gaining ground and they are also part of the groups pushing for transparency in elections. The coming mid term elections combined with the on going lawsuits is going to make things very interesting and I expect things to get strange before hand.  Hopefully I am wrong on things going strange but the current activity tends to point towards it going that way. I am expecting something like LAs Vegas happening again to create the shock value and the justification of action by the left. I hope that I am wrong.
Biden just confirmed he came to the US Senate 120 years ago....
Wow... just got back in.. Thst was not easy.. lol
Hi @Sancho Nice to meet you. Krissy in Pueblo here.
Vedicwarrior, Windy, peacemaker45, 1patriot, glad you're on here.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/CO?msg=8Aw8qhbCSZmqr4TZH) Thanks! Whatever I can to help
Hi Krissy, there is another OK guy in Pueblo, will put you in touch with him.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/CO?msg=Cy66EKrxqnQKKinDn) Please do! I'm totally isolated here. Just moved to community in August (escaping the chaos in Denver). It would be nice to have some local OK connections. I tried to do some recruiting after I moved here, but got nowhere with it (or more recently in Trinidad) but would like to renew those efforts if I had some assistance. Feel free to PM me if you have more specific questions.
Regarding NoKo, he's been "consoling" with our partners
35 questions on both the Tech and General. Yes, you can sit for both. Your Tech exam will be graded and confirmed passed before they give you the Gen exam.
Beware though. The VEs at my test center said it's not uncommon for test takers intending to take both Tech and General exams end up FAILING the Tech exam. Test takers make the mistake of thinking, if they study for the General exam, surely that will prepare them for the Tech exam. Not so. Don
...Don't underestimate the Tech exam.
I totally agree. I was kinda forced to retire when covid hit but work some part time. I never was in combat so I don‚Äôt have those types of skills. But like I said will do all I can to help. 
No I won't, I hear you there plus the limitations for tech are specific to that classification and most likely won't be focused on in the general study guide.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=r58fYPjfgDA3ufJDS) @SCORPION   I share your enthusiasm. But I can't find a single OKer within 20 mi of my undisclosed, underground bunker. Either there are none, or they turned tail, or they've gone dark. 

OKers in or near Scottsdale, AZ:  IF YOU CAN HEAR ME, GIVE ME A SIGN OF LIFE. #AZ
To summarize where we are at in CO, we need to work local, form groups not necessarily OK.  Stewart has recommended these groups focus on community safety and coherence.  Ideally this can be through community watch programs as well as emergency medical training such as stop the bleed and search and rescue.  There is also the aspect of making your training and access available for Sherriff possee if they are willing to do so, many are not..
See? . . . Crickets.
If you do not already have Signal, please download it and let me know.  OKs are continuously vetting and running background checks for new members and if you do not hear anything in 2-4 weeks time, please feel free to bug me or another chat member when we get more squared away.
If you have a long way to drive to get to your testing site, yeah, I'd consider prepping for both exams in one sitting.
Have you tried this study app. The HAM Radio Exam by Roy Watson it's on android

The only thing holding me here is my wife and there isn't much left to hold onto. I bought a 36' Class-A diesel pusher just before I retired planned on leaving for a 5 year tour of the US and Canada from Alaska to the Yukon out to Wyoming and across the northern border states. But I tore my hip and the VA dragged their feet fixing me so I went outside for repair. Just got close to 85% and 4 or 5 weeks ago in the freezover we had I took a big slip on the ice and got a high ankle sprain. 2nd day off crutches. Getting old sucks.

Now if you'll pardon us . . . Miss Abigail Adams and I have business to tend in a Private Message chat.
Nice to meet you too. Yes, I'm single. Been divorced for 10 years.
I've been "looking" for EIGHT YEARS.
Single sucks.
I'm 54. All the women in my age group are married.
Right now, central Florida preparing to return to far west Texas, Presidio area.
Damn!  Do you have ANY patriots in your area to aid and assist?
These lessons are a few years out of date, however, if you listen to them, you SHOULD be able to pass your TECH Test the very next day...

That's so kind of you!  Though Colorado is long way from Scottsdale, AZ.  :disappointed: 

I've been reading and looking for your posts.

I don't understand your DM chat "almost wrote you in your role as AZ leadership."  I'm not in AZ leadership. It's a cluster right now. Are you in state or national OK leadership?
Pardon me, ~if~ *while* I barf...
Scorpion, Thank you for asking but I've only been an ok for a month or so and haven't heard a peep from anyone in my AO. I'm near Boston and I've reached out from Connecticut to New Hampshire. No responses at all. Just yesterday I deleted my outreach messages on those regional chats. I think too many have turned tail and run from what they perceive to be negative federal attention towards the OKs. Personally I go the other way. After the BS slant being laid out against the right on Jan6th (yet BLM & Antifa members were having charges dropped like hot potatoes) I had to sign up. Much the same as after 9/11. I  hadn't served since 87 but had to put my hat back in the ring and went to Iraq in the early part of OIF. Sorry for dragging on but I get revved up about this shit.
Yes, let's chat, flirt, post, and see where it goes. :blush: 

I'm a regular OK member too, but not former mil or LE. A little EMT experience but mostly just an ardent patriot and III%.
I've been an OKer since 2010.
Hmmm. I don't know if there is anything I can teach YOU.
AZ leadership has asked me to wait while they sort things out.
Wow right around the corner. I live in Charlotte in Steele Creek.
...I suspect state leadership is waiting on national leadership.
I'm afraid there will be no escape, no matter the state, before long.
We're entering a dark period of American history.
Like I said recently, this period of disorganization in OK and patriot groups may be a blessing---gives the Left more time to overreach, bringing more Americans onboard with the fact the election was a total sham.
I just ordered my technicians & general class study manuals from the local ARRL.
Thank you.  Incidentally, I'm all about monogamy. I'm as loyal as the sunrise.  God did not intend men to be bachelors.
YAY!  I've got the ARRL General License, spiral-bound book on the way too. Arrives tomorrow. Can't wait!
Hey SCORPION! i'm about 25 miles ENE of city, not sure when/where your rolling thru at... don't drink cept black coffee & water lol! - shoot me an email & we can tweak the logistics!
Good stuff! You can look up Part One, but here is Part Two. Just released:
https://youtu.be/5U28iOU1DOo
My mom was Lutheran. My dad Catholic.  We were baptized, raised, and confirmed in the Lutheran church. I've since converted to Catholicism. I love my Faith and have nothing but fond kinship for my Protestant and Jewish brothers and sisters.
Good stuff! I believe one of you guys posted Part One of this. Here is Part Two. Just released:
https://youtu.be/5U28iOU1DOo
watching your video...
That's a great story. I like your Patroness. My patron saint happens to be a Patroness as well, St. Teresa of Avila. We're buds.  You might appreciate St. Teresa was a bit of a mystic. That's what drew me to her. Coincidentally, HER patron saint is a man, St. Joseph.
That's awful about your annulment. 

My annulment was approved, but I suppose having been married in a Lutheran church kinda greased the skids. :laughing:
Hey. You still on here?  It went down before I got to follow back up with you.  What is the state of the JeffCo GOP vote audit?
It was the saints who sold me on the Catholic Church.
Hah! My ex didn't think so  :joy:
That's so funny . . . I was just about to ask you about kids.
I have one. My son. 17. He's my world. 

He's right behind me, in an online class. HS junior.
Thank you. And there's still hope for your daughter. I married in my 30s.
Hey brother, good to see the forum is back up. Laying low and waiting to see what's going to happen, lot of disinformation flying around. What a cluster fuck. Have you heard anything? This is dharsas.
Thank you so much for chatting with me. I like you! Enjoy your walk, and we'll pick this up again soon.
I don't know what quality of books I'll be getting, they didn't mention options. It was in the 70 dollar range for the two.
Anyone around the Akron-canton area of Ohio? I‚Äôm in the Ohio chat but it‚Äôs dead in there.

Anything from ARRL is great, and will remain a go-to in your ham library.
Nice. What kind of shot gun?

What dates you be in Waco?
I live right south of Waco
Welcome to the renewed Colorado chat!  New vetted members can join us on signal. Colorado chapter is rebuilding also. If your feeling isolated or left out, speak up. We will be monitoring this chat regularly going forward.  Thank you for being an Oathkeeper!
Sweet. I got a saiga 12 with 20rds drum mags. Hands down my favorite gun. 
I know.
Damn pain in the ass
Still no way to look up group members? Or state members?
@windy that is some "hot stuff".  Went to USN fire fighting school myself.  I can say it was an intense experience!
Howdy y'all
That is why I needed you to log in.  Have not been able to do that without the person being logged in.
As things progress I will create a CO-Vetted chat that will be by invite only.
ah gotcha
@windy you have not seen isolated until you have been an Oath Keeper in NYC!  Feel like a one man French Underground!
So for its the most enjoyable one I have I also got a 2 Round mag so I hunt with it 
It only took 3 months, but I think I found the Florida chat. A big hello from the Nature Coast.
They are fun. 
Yes we do. I just wish we had more in this chat. Maybe the local leads would be nice. 
Hey that's great. I've been away with a death in my family so don't know when you posted this. If you would be good enough to sign onto MYMilitia.com, MarkB., is the person in charge of Lancaster County Pennsylvania Pure Patriots listed on that site. We would all be extremely greatful to have you with us. Rick
@jpj Thanks for the kind words and encouragement. I can't imagine being an OK in NYC. You should get the Medal of Honor just for that...lol I guess my situation has a lot to do with the timing. I had just settled in Denver (a Tennessee girl with no connection to the state) when the shit hit the fan with the scamdemic. The job opportunity I came here for fell through because of it, and I was effectively left stranded with no friends, family or other support. I haven't been feeling the love from Colorado, but I would still like to make it work for me. Maybe you guys will help me find community at least. That would help. I don't know anyone here in Pueblo, where I've lived for 7 months, and haven't met anyone or had any kind of life. Can't wait to hear more about your NYC journey!
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/CO?msg=rbnq1u0S2KOPqDVoK) Hi Groot! Nice to meet you. I've been on here for a couple of weeks. Yes, feeling isolated (see my recent posts). Hoping to meet other patriots here in the Pueblo/Colorado Springs area, if you can hook me up. I'll get back on Signal. I was on for a long time, until it started having serious some serious glitches and functional issues, so I got off. Thank you for your work in rebuilding the OK presence here!
What dates?
Where exactly are you located redfox? I‚Äôm canton area. In between alliance and Minerva 
Pueblo is a tough town. We lived there three years and I never liked it. Dry and dirty. You should  come check out Colorado Springs.  Its nicer, more options.

I had nothing to do with this sites development. I just like to greet new members and get them in our signal group.  However I'm not the one who vets people and we don't add anyone to our signal chat until then. Sounds like yours is in progress and that you will soon be good to go. There are at least two others in Pueblo.  I'm close enough to come down for a meet and greet too.
I do not have a protonmail. I‚Äôll set one up tomorrow. I‚Äôm in stark county. You know anyone there?
Perhaps good news, but I do not think I would ever have a use for a bump stock.  I like to actually take aim.
Windy @stewart-rhodes is in the process of vetting folks in CO and when he is done they will start vetting others at which time you will I am sure hear from a CO person.
Speak of the Head Honcho!
Will do. 
Thanks for explaining the Signal chat process. Good to know there's some others here in Pueblo. I can generally go as far as far north as Colorado Springs and to Trinidad in the South. Basically, an hour's drive each way, is as far as I'm comfortable taking my old Buick. Would love to meet you, whenever we can work it out. Hope life is treating you well in your neck of the woods. -- Krissy
Understood and I agree. I‚Äôll get set up and let you know mine tomorrow.

hey stfletcher, Waco here..
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=4cmwHJ3ANP3GfZwuS) This is disturbing, especially since the Navy doesn't even define what "extremism" is. I'm not sure I know what it is...lol America is considered an "extremist" country in China and Iran, with all our freedoms (pre-2020, at least). The military I knew was always the epitome of dignity, respect and patriotism. Has anything changed with that? Sounds like more divide-and-conquer BS to further mess with the minds of the people who need to be focused on defending us against the REAL threats.They don't need this crap. We can't afford to have such PC nonsense driving our military.
Has there been any comments on this from leadership. 
I want a Mossberg
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/TX?msg=9aKhzrmi9rNcKjAh7) Figured I'd go ahead and direct message you.I'm in Waco and would like to be included in the meet up
Which one?
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=G6yiBkhwJ2sjxnhnn) This needs to be investigated to we get to the bottom of it, and whoever responsible held accountable. Sounds like a Deep State plot to me.
Yeah I highly doubt it happened like they are claiming. This shit is getting out of hand. 
Hey dman. South of Spartanburg here. Welcome
Yep tons of stuff swirling about.
Aside from the fact that you can't trust a thing the MSM says anymore, IF this report is true, then I have even more respect than ever for our Founder. I wasn't at the Capitol on 1/6, but was following closely the events of the week leading up to it, and watching an independent journalist live-stream of it when it happened. Based on that--and the powerful arguments in support of it by Mr. Rhodes in his Open Letters to the the president--there is no question in my mind that President Trump should have invoked the Insurrection Act long prior to 1/6, to take down BLM/Antifa and re-run the election with paper ballots and photo ID's, which would have prevented it ever getting to this whole Capitol fiasco. I don't understand the reasons the president did not act, but I was totally stunned that he didn't, and by not doing so, I feel strongly that he failed in his fundamental duty as president.

That said, what I saw later was a president--neither willing to concede, nor doing what was fully within his power to do, to restore Constitutional rule--but instead, asking his supporters to do the impossible for him, i.e. flood the Capitol on 1/6, to somehow influence the outcome of this last chance for the election to be overturned by Congress and Pence); and making very ambiguous public statements (saying things like, "Its going to be wild," and even flying the 1776 Revolutionary Flag over the White House!) which I personally interpreted as a symbolic call for We the People to act, as the last line of defense against the illegal overthrow of our Republic. That, my friends, is what I understand to be the job of an Oath Keeper.

All the credible evidence regarding that event, that I've been able to review, to date (and there is still much that is being hidden by the communist dictator occupying the Oval Office) shows that Mr. Rhodes and our Oath Keeper contingent there that day did there job in putting their lives on the line to make a final stand for Liberty. Sadly, no one else did (including President Trump)...and there lies the true tragedy of 1/6. Truth be known, the Deep State/Communist overthrow of our duly-elected government should have ended that day. IF Mr. Rhodes said those things he is alleged to have said to the OK troops there, then I would just say, he is a truth-teller and a genuine American hero. I know that that is exactly what I would have done in his position, given the monumental stakes involved, my love for freedom and liberty, and my total commitment to my Oath.

Yes, the whole road to 1/6 was total chaos on a scale never seen before in our lifetimes, just as the enemy had successfully planned it to be. But 1/6 was our last chance to save the Republic, and I (as well as millions of Americans loyal to the Constitution) were praying with everything they had that day for a miracle to save us from the fate that has since materialized. For all the still-suspicious, unexplained shenanigans that went on that day from the many bad-actors involved, when I saw the Capitol being entered by the protesters, for a few treasured moments that I will never forget, I was praying that REAL PATRIOTS were at work there, taking back our country and restoring American freedom and liberty. And after all is said and done, there is only one aspect of that day that I would bet my life on. And that is that Mr. Rhodes DID THE RIGHT THING. He paid (and continue to pay) a huge price for his sacrifice in this fight, and in that, he has shown his mettle as true and worthy leader in our cause, and set an example that we can should all be very proud of in standing behind him every step of the way, going forward. 

Regardless @stewart-rhodes, please know that your Open Letters to President Trump and your actions of 1/6--like no other act of bravery I have seen since March, 2020--make this American woman proud to be an Oath Keeper. And I shall follow you, to the last breath, to save We the People from the existential threat to humanity which now faces us.
The 6th and the days leading up to it were a clusterfuck of epic proportions both on and off this message board, lacking clear leadership, communication and discipline.
And that is precisely why some members find themselves in their current predicament.
Hey buddy, good to hear form you.!
I'll probably get banned now for speaking the truth... we'll soon find out lol
Yeah there's a lot of disinformation out there and plenty of goons that believe it and unless its the feel good shit they don't want to hear it. I just found the forum was back today and have been reading comments but not posting. Only DM the people I know.
Well, fwiw, I'm glad you're back and hope you and yours are all doing well...
This Windy gal seems to be a resurrection of the one gal we had on here before it went down. Same complaints from the group as a whole. Same ole' same ole'.
At least there's no crazy JSC types...
Yeah we are all doing good, tossed my other stepson out for being a dumb ass. Can't have people in my house doing shit that compromises the rest of us. Had a shooting on I-10 near here today. Guy ran from DPS in Houston and then spiked his tires at Columbus and then ran on the rims to Schulenberg were he go out of the vehicle and began shooting at anyone who came near and finally shot himself.
Crazy shit is getting worse, how goes things where you are?
Commifornia is... well, Commifornia!
At least I got the rental house I had been working on finally rented!
Cool, good renters I hope.
Air Force. Young couple with a kid. But fuck if they didn't just get orders to Lackland. Fuck me sideways - I can never win.
But they said they'd help me get a new tenant, hopefully someone just coming in on orders here
Awesome. Going to hang out with my wife now that she's home from work. Talk at ya later. Good night brother.
G'night, Chief...
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=A5umLw4SMfM5s4FQD) I have great respect for your dedication to our nation, and absolutely no doubt about the sincerity of your comment here. But given everything we know about what happened that day, and that the whole situation leading up to 1/6 was indeed a "clusterfuck of epic proportions" [nice!], I would truly appreciate your reflections on what specifically could and should have been done differently, I admit that I am an imperfect human being, as well as new OK member who has much to learn. I even hesitated to comment, out of respect for so many of you who have sacrificed so much in the defense of liberty, for this organization and in your personal lives over the past year.

Furthermore, I do sense that the OK is at a historical low point in its morale, and keep hearing that recurrent theme of communications and "lack of leadership" that you cite as being the key problems for the organization. It just appears from my vantage, that Mr. Rhodes did his level best under virtually impossible odds and overwhelming factors that he had no control over. And that, at the end of the day, he at least led the battle with courage and integrity. I would even venture to guess that Mr. Rhodes himself (as would President Trump!) have done things differently, given foresight of the level of pure evil and treachery our enemy was willing to stoop to topple our Republic. No one is more disappointed than me of the outcome, but he's one leader who I think can hold his head high in his response to this sad period of our history.

If I am wrong, please set me straight. I'm really interested in hearing what would you have done? What have you and the organization learned from this experience? And what do you feel needs to happen, going forward, for us to have a chance of succeeding in our mission? I am here because, in spite of its flaws, I believe the OK has the best chance of leading the resurrection of American greatness, and am interested in using the lessons of the past to achieve our ultimate victory.

Will do. Been busy the last few days with work but I will and we can start working together
This is what an empire in collapse looks like.  There is no way to stop it or reverse it.  Maybe....we can slow it down by kicking the can of tyranny a little further down the road.  Getting involved locally is our only hope at this point.  Trump should have done is duty, but he is either part of the machine or he is ignorant and solely focused on himself.  They will come for all of us who do not accept the official narrative.
Ok I messaged Scorpion to see when he be here. Otherwise it‚Äôs you, Lovejoy, and myself. I can‚Äôt make it this weekend but maybe sometime in next week or two. She is out by Teague so maybe somewhere east of Waco or if she has to come into Waco for anything 
New protonmail...... OhioNomad1776@protonmail.com. 
Good Morning Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea!
Couldn't find it, but I did find a bunch of shit that I thought I lost 
I'll look again most likely this weekend 
Looks like @windy was knocking it out of the park last night. I'm proud to be in her company, that of @stewart-rhodes, and my fellow OKers. 

Regarding the events of *January 6th, the "storming of the Capitol"* . . . 

I don‚Äôt know why Trump called for a rally that day. It didn‚Äôt make sense. Trump failed to invoke the Insurrection Act in the weeks between the election and inauguration, a colossal failure to fulfill his solemn oath as president. And why schedule a big Trump rally in the middle of the week? I don‚Äôt get it. Pence was always a lost cause. (Trump chose Pence to be his VP in 2016, precisely because Pence was an establishment Republican, ‚Äúbalancing‚Äù the Republican ticket.)

As for the hundreds of thousands of Trump supporters and conservatives who attended the rally, January 6th, those are my peeps! Love you guys. Wish I could have been there.

As for the ‚Äústorming‚Äù of the Capitol? I thought it was GLORIOUS, with the exception of the tragic killing of patriot Ashli Babbit and the unfortunate fatal stroke of Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick.

*Glorious indeed!* Capitol Hill is the people‚Äôs house. We paid for that building. We still pay for that building, the lights, utilities, cleaning, maintenance, and security. The grounds are ours to stand upon. The roof, ours to occupy. Open the damn doors!

The floor of the senate does not belong to senators. It belongs to us, Americans‚Äîthe senate‚Äôs chairs, carpet, desks, microphones, tapestries, the whole damn thing. All of it belongs to the people. (As for the private offices of our elected officials, those doors should‚Äôve remained secure and offices inviolable, out of respect for individual rights to privacy.)

I am so proud of ALL the patriots who attended the day‚Äôs rally. 

*History will correctly liken the storming of the Capitol to the Boston Tea Party.*

Yes, Antifa and BLM played a role in instigating the breach of the locked building and consequent property damage. Did Antifa and BLM‚Äôs planned participation rise to the level of a false flag event? Hah! I wouldn‚Äôt give those Lost Boys that much credit. Conservatives are adults, we take responsibility for our actions. Blaming the storming of the Capitol on leftwing agent provocateurs is demeaning. Please, just stop it.

Good morning Patriots!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The app works better on the phone than the web interface by most reports.
We should all grab a copy of this bill, and send it to our own state reps and say we want this in our state.
This is the Boulder live stream. www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikujTMetrUk   Paste it into another tab and watch it until he gets kicked out of the parking lot then watch it again. Though I will be accused of "conjecture" by at least one person here, I see this event as a hoax. Not a false flag -- a hoax. It appears to be simply a cop training exercise.
Well said. I think you're right that "this is what an empire in collapse looks like." We can slow it down, kick the can of tyranny down the road without solving the root issue. I'm glad I'm not the only one here who felt that Trump blew (previously phenomenal) legacy by not fighting the cabal to stop their takeover. Based on that, I have BIG questions, as you do, about Trump's being part of the machine (its the only explanation for why he didn't do any of the things in his last months in office that we all expected him to do that would have saved us to at least hold the line and give us a chance to turn things around). But like us, Trump is but a human being, and for all his business genius, he's not God, and may have simply been ignorant or given up when faced with new challenges he wasn't prepared for, and not having the stomach for the fight it would ensue, and deluding himself he could still make a bloodless comeback after relinquishing office. As you say, its really hard to put a positive spin on it. 

You definitely hit the nail on the head as to the main reason we're in this situation, not so much the failure of OK leadership, but for a perfect storm of events and situations we were not prepared for. For all the things that may need improvement here at OK Central, you guys were there for him, doing all you could do to support him! You should always be proud of that. Remember, its that spirit absolute commitment to truth and freedom that has impressed me and many more to join the OK in recent months, and talking to you all here since, that still make me have hope for the future.

And to your most important point. Yes, they are coming after us full steam! Our lives and the lives of our families are in danger as never before (even on the field of battle in foreign lands), and every bit as much as were our Founding Fathers at the beginning of the Revolution. Perhaps taking a decentralized approach as many are saying here, focusing on community outreach and development is ultimately the most realistic and effective, short-term strategy we can hope for. But if we are to fulfill our true mission as defenders of what's left of the Republic, we must keep the conversation going about these things, keep working together, keep speaking out, constructively, about new creative solutions and strategies for victory. What is and isn't working with our organizational leadership and process, to stop the train wreck and begin turning it around. 

We must not give in to defeat and despair. Rather, learning from and integrating all these hard lessons of the past, we must still come together, reach deep into our souls--both individually, as regional communities, and as an organization--to rise to the occasion and figure this thing out fast! Even if that plan is a "red state"/"blue" state secession/partition plan (which I personally feel is our best option at this point, given that we will never again have a fair election under the current circumstances). And we need to be *PROACTIVE* (as opposed to reactive) to events. WE need to be writing the script and driving the narrative. while acknowledging the true depths of depravity of our enemy, and the the daunting nature of our predicament, 

We can no longer afford to spend precious days and weeks debating over the failures and mistakes that we, Trump, or anyone else made. We must continue to fight with every fiber of our being, up our game, learn to outflank own limitations and those of our enemy. We must do this, if for no other reason than the debt we owe for the blood of three centuries of patriots before us who gave their very blood for our freedom. And to our children and future generations who will never know the freedom that we once had, if we do not. All who are willing to fight and die for this cause must unite and come together now to give it all we have for a final stand for the Republic. There is now no greater purpose for my life now that this. and I could not cannot live with myself, if I were to take any other path.  America, Lady Liberty, our God-given natural rights are still worth fighting (and dying) for. 

In conclusion, we need to change our mission from simply "keeping our Oath" to a Constitution on life support, to becoming freedom fighters, living our freedom and fighting for it. For in fighting for our freedom, we are living it. And in living it, who knows? Perhaps even accomplishing more permanent than just kicking the can of tyranny down the road a little longer. Instead, how about we just commit, here and now, to wiping out evil once for all?
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=s5LfXhSRaGr6gy5Xd) Absolutely! Let's that do that!!
@Keeping.AZ BRAVO, my brother. Truer words have never been said, and THIS is the "narrative"-- the real one!--we must not lose sight of! History, I believe, will judge Trump's actions in his last weeks in office very harshly, but the OK'ers (and all who were there in DC that day to uphold the Constitution) were indeed heroes! In retrospect, I just wish they had overwhelming firepower, and had been successful in seizing control, and igniting Revolution 2.0. A lot of things we'll look back on, for sure, to determine how we lost that one shining opportunity to turn the tide, but make no mistake about it, all who were there that day with honorable intent were heroes. While I would have preferred it had been our generation's Yorktown, 1/6 was nothing less than our generation's Boston Tea Party, and all that that implies. That you for all you guys do and have done. And thanks to you @Keeping.AZ for starting this brilliant dialogue on the very relevant historical parallels with the situation faced by our Founding Fathers. We must never lose sight of those lessons nor their passion for liberty.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=g8zmgfsmXicQzkvyS) Good morning, Ron! Nice to meet you. I salute you for always starting our day out here with the Pledge of Allegiance. In setting no limits for what we can accomplish with God's help, we will live up to that Pledge, and fulfill the destiny of this great land, that it shall not perish in vain.
Ohhh. Hah. I'm 55. I'm losing track!
I'm good. I see you've been busy this morning.
Yeah, I think that happens when you turn 55.
You were on FIRE  last night and this morning, burning up the chat.
Hi, Krissy.
I'm thrilled you're here.
I like your compassion. Trump failed terribly in failing to invoke the IA. But I like your compassion for his human frailty.
There won't be another free and fair election until after the civil war.
For those hoping for a Trump come back in 2024, I have sad news for them.
Trump wasn't running against Biden---he was running against the entire SWAMP. Almost single-handed.
Ohhh, btw, I can be your "brother" in the General chat. BUT I'm your husband in here, okay? :wink:
I've been thinking a lot about Trumps actions at the end of his term and when I compare and contrast those actions with actions during his presidency, I see a man who abhors violence and will do almost anything to avoid it.  He's the first president in the last century to not start or get us into a new war and worked to get us out of current ones.  He also wanted to work within the legal framework of the Constitution and Federal law and would often bend the rules, but would never break them.  Socialists break the rules whenever it suits their ends.
Another thought I've ran through my head is the lack of military leadership that supported Trump; we have a lot of Obama holdovers within the DOD and Pentagon who routinely worked against Trump and would have ordered a stand down immediately if Trump invoked the Insurrection Act.
Although Trumps actions would have been Constitutionally justified, the results would have been symbolic and ultimately pyric.
The people have to look to the founders and follow their example.  The system cannot fix itself.
Thank you for your thoughtful reply. Pyric indeed, though it was the Left who boldly stolen the election.
You are a crack up. I love your mix of tender-heart and bold feminine strength.
You definitely got my ATTENTION.
The Left has destroyed our country.  I believe we are at the point of no return and whichever "side" of this political civil war wins will transform the country into something new.  At the moment, it appears that a Socialist dictatorship is in the near future.  If that comes to fruition, they will make teh 3rd Reich look like a rehearsal.
:relaxed:   :smiling_face_with_3_hearts:
Oh, and I use the Nazi reference literally since the radical Left exhibits more Fascist characteristics than Communist ones.
Got your text. Thank you.
Yup. An eventuality.
You look a bit older than 59 in your pic. Is there something you're not telling me?
Remember the first rule of Guerrilla club: You don't talk about Guerrilla club!  At least not on a chat service that has moles embedded in it looking for members of the club.
I don't know what I need half the time.
The Nazi's were Leftist. Communists are Left. The two were slugging it out in the streets of Germany for leftist control of the country.  After WWII, the Leftist in the media and academia in the USA, began a campaign to convince Americans that Communists were on the left and Nazis were on the right. Not true. Nazism is as far left as communism, just a different branch.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=eePTCjSMT3JCY2uzr) Awesome analysis! I agree, but don't think he realized the existential nature of the threat of the situation. I can forgive him for that, as none of us saw this coming on so many different levels. Lots of questions about the military's role too, I agree.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=rGm7DhNGvNYsCYTuw) If they call it "Mandatory Buy Back" then that means they sold us the guns to start with and the government needs to be held accountable for felons having them or wackos using them. After all, you are buying them back which means you gave them out. Redfox is correct, they just use that term to lesson the narrative of confiscation.
Naturally you have my support. Now let's go take this country back!
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=EFEQ9sCnHxnWeivPW) "Guerill Club"...I like that! There are moles everywhere. I assume the NSA has every phone call and text I've ever made at their fingertips. What do we do to have a private group conversation now?
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=oZL3n6veSktePYxij) They can call it what they want, but its still tyranny. We just do not give our weapons to them, plain and simple. If possible, we accumulate more, however we have to do it. I have a friend who is looking at getting into 3D printing of guns, which would be near impossible to legislate against or stop, and where you can make just about anything you want. They are still ironing out some of the safety issues with it, but they are getting very close to perfection with the process now. Could be the wave of the future for freedom fighters across the globe. I'm hopeful, but at the same time, I think we need total resistance to the "buy back" campaign, which will be their next step
_If they call it "Mandatory Buy Back" then that means they sold us the guns to start with, . . . _--- @Viper-Strike 

The Left truly believes the gov't is "buying back" the guns. How could that be? The Left does not recognize God-given unalienable rights. The Left believes your rights are given to you by the government. In the eyes of the Left, your ability to bear arms was a privilege given to you by the gov't. Now that the Left is in control of the gov't, they are simply "taking back" a "privilege" the gov't had afforded you under conservative administrations.
@Viper-Strike gave me an idea. Perhaps OK could be instrumental in creating a new industrial revolution around the production of 3D-printed weapons? We will of course have to have weapons and ammo to maintain even our local sovereignty, so it makes sense to fight fire with fire, and find creative ways to make them and get them. Likewise @zephius reminded me of the never-ending vulnerability of our online and cell phone platforms to moles, hacking, and cyber-attack. I have no idea how, but somehow we will have to plug that hole, and find new defenses against it, so we know we can have airtight secure conversations like this (Maxwell Smart's "Bubble of Silence" comes to mind...lol). Infiltration by enemy spies will remain an huge ongoing concern (as recently illustrated by the FBI trying to recruit former Green Beret, Jeremy Brown, recently to infiltrate us). Any ideas to address the security issue, I would think to be of the highest priority.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=kC4wKwLkY2CQ8WGgY) I am a closet historian on Socialism and its cousins, so you have no argument from me on that.  They are two sides of the same extremist coin, but both are deeply rooted in Marxism.  Many argue that Nazism was rooted in Hagelism, but I disagree if you carefully observe the policies of the 3rd Reich as they were Marxist in their actions.  Nazism is also not Fascism (that was the formerly Marxist Mussolini's flavor of a "proper" Marxist nation state), but for the sake of the audience's attention I don't go into that detail.
The main difference between the two is one observes grouping by economic class while the other groups by race.  Both are destructive, but grouping by race is more destructive in the short run while the other is more destructive in the long run.  I suppose the question is whether a nation wants death immediately or further down the line.
Very few Americans are aware they've been bamzooled into thinking Nazism is extreme conservatism.  It took me years to unravel all those lies I was taught in school.
HAM radio using PKI.
Or P2P communication using PKI.  For those of you who are not technically inclined: PKI = Public Key Infrastructure which means distributed encryption.
That would be a tentative solution, if we we could all move to HAM radio. I need to learn about PKI!
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=QeScAJwjobAxBQfdq) Sounds like the solution! Where do I start?
Totally agree, that sounds like, barring a better idea, that's the direction we need to be moving in.
Both technologies already exist and aren't difficult to implement.  I think HAM using encryption is the better way to go since it's harder to compromise
And cheaper to run
You would need a large network of friendly relays though to make it useable nation wide
And distributing the encryption key would be tricky since you need the key before you can decrypt the transmission
Windy, I agree. When great minds come together, nothing is impossible and this too cam be overcome when we work together.
I think a lot of weight or figuring things out tends to be placed upon the local/state commanders. But we all need to have ideas on how we can remain free and keep our God given rights, no matter the cost. After all, freedom isn't free and we have to pay the cost so our future generations can have the freedom we had growing up. I would hate to think my grandkids are under CCP rule once I'm gone. I am of Greek heritage and Spartacus courage runs through my blood.
That's why Socialists put so much energy into forming and repeating their precious Narrative.  Marx and Hitler both wrote entire chapters on the value of creating and perpetuating a great lie to bomboozal the masses, as you put it.
That's also why the people need Patriots to shout even louder and more often the truth to act as a counter to the blindfold of propaganda
Wendy, Here is my first idea. I think this needs to be pushed in every state. People of each state need to demand a bill like this get pushed through.

You're right, it will take us all pulling together and giving our best, if we are to save America (or anywhere in the world, for that matter) from becoming a dystopian slave empire, as they seem hellbent on trying to make it. It our future generations that I think of here too, and which motivates me to maintain hope.

jpj, Keeping.AZ, chiroeurope... Your thoughts on choosing between a "tri-band HT" vs an "All Mode Analog Ultra Compact Mobile/Base Transceiver" setup in a go bag with a lightweight li-ion battery pack and several antenna options.

@Viper-Strike We need that Ancient Greek Spartacus strength and spirit  of yours, here now more than ever!
The latter coming in at somewhere between 5lbs on the low end and 12lbs on the high side.
We/someone or anyone needs to setup a nationwide channel/site for all militias to access and communicate through. Right now, all 2nd A's groups, militias and organizations do not communicate with each other. How can we ALL work together without communicating with each other? Every group including ones from outside our group needs to be in sink with each other. This would be one hell of a task and would take a lot of traveling and vetting to accomplish, let along the investment of secure transmitting capabilities. How do you know in the Florida Militia, Michigan Militia, Pa, and all the rest just to name a few? They are sitting ducks for the feds to annihilate being on their own, but united, we are a voice that will be heard. Antifa, BLM, and other communist groups are united and communicate. But the 2a orgs throughout our nation, well they aren't.
Nice thing about this bill is, it also does away with the Federal Firearms Act of 1938.
Is there anything else you need from me?

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=Lx2PpDMQz8pFD28xr) Totally agree. Hit the nail on the head again, further defining the specifics of the challenge and a potential solution for it. The nationwide channel/site sounds very do-able. To re-build and and become an effective force for positive change, we all have to get it together on the communications front. The status quo on our communications isn't sustainable with the threats we've discussed. We need need to do something, and this would be an extremely worthy project!
I work at Barnes & Phillips Real Estate www.barnesandphillipsrealestate.net
I have a patriot friend here in Colorado who has knowledge of HAM radio and is putting up an antennae. I will talk to him about to see who we could get a Beta system up and running asap
@ssgtgman  HT. That "go bag" of yours will quickly become a "no-go bag" if you add 12 lbs for comms.  I'd save the weight displacement for more water, food, medical, solar charger, or ammo.
Would love for General Flynn to head this up under the title of UM United Militias. They have the UN, we can have the UM. He could get all of the groups organized under one umbrella with respects of each group retaining their group name & group control.
I think a better move would be to organize local communities into militias and begin pressuring local municipalities and counties to reject the unconstitutional actions and policies of the State and Federal governments.  Imagine counties across the Union refusing to shut down churches, business, schools, etc., enforce speech codes, or promulgate racial based legislation.  You know, support personal liberty and capitalism.
Here it comes:  https://nypost.com/2021/03/26/jen-psaki-says-biden-will-sign-gun-control-executive-orders/
I hear you there. Just trying to "weigh out" the advantages in full-band coverage over the dual or at best tri-band HTs and value for dollar. Obviously if kept the wattage down the weight quickly drops below 2lbs, 3lbs with battery and antenna.

Depending on how much you were willing to spend, if you could get one of those OK stickers or the design from somewhere) you could have one custom made where they do custom embroidery. If you're in a fairly good size town, there's usually one or two who do that kind of thing. If not, there are places online where you can get a quote to get it done. I have one link to a place like that, so let me know if you're interested and I'll give it to you. Good luck. We definitely need OK gear, patches, etc. to proudly display our colors!

They can use my protonmail same name as here.
The elected Republicans 97% are not worth their weight in salt. They don't want to except the fact the Republic was not given to us. We won the Republic and our liberty through violence. Yes violence civil disobedience that started in Lexington on April 1775. In my opinion President Trump had the time to see the Courts were against him. He should have declared Martial Law in the seven corrupt States. Now we are in deep shit. The only thing we get from our Republican Representatives is lip service and talk about the 2022 election. This election will be worse then the 2020 and who will stop the scumbags. I believe Trump needs now to stand up and take action or say no more and play golf. RedPatriot76/21.

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=ZLxc5er5Fp953DNBM) Great points! I totally agree (amazing how great minds think alike :slight_smile: I think we're zeroing in on a solution here. The only problem is, I don't think Trump's going to do it. If not, where does that leave us?
Wow! Disturbing about Biden's dementia. The guy even said today he's running for re-election in 2024! He's totally out of it
charley556,  I agree. The Republican party has far too many RINOs in it and we can't afford to have a one. And yes it appears that Trump stepped down without the fight we all expected from him. But perhaps he saw that the courts where in the bag as they refused to hear cases that we all know they should have. It's extremely frustrating to put it mildly.
Better than protonmail?
See my earlier post regarding Trump.  The sooner we all realize that Trump is not the messiah and it is up to the people to band together to rebuild the Republic, the better.
The Republican party establishment is filled to the brim with Looters (Read Frederic Bastiat's "The Law" for more on what I mean about that term).  They collude with the rest of the political class to enslave the masses.
Again I couldn't agree more.
Each of us must do as we can to support the Republic. Too many want someone else to stand in the gap. Is it going to be costly? Yes. Are those who support the Republic risking everything? Yes. My writing this puts my family at risk were I am writing it from. Yet here I am doing that. I am working on moving my family back to the US, when I have offers to move to other countries that don't have the conflict that the US has and will continue to have. I could easily move and insure safety and security for my family, very easily. Only the price tags are way too high as I know without doubt that when America falls the UN, China, and the other Globalist groups will push their agenda on the rest of the world and there will be no power that will stop them.

So what can I do: I am moving my family back to the US. We are designing radio comm's that can be deployed and can be made secure. We are making bridges with other groups that are serious about the natural rights of the individual and the rule of law. Reaching out to folks, to not expect others to save them; but to stand and do what we can. I know that I and my wife will be walking into hell as we plan on helping hold government accountable. We are parents and we know without doubt that the state will try to go after our kids. Yet we will fight. We also know that unless you show folks how to stand and help give them voice, that we will be seen as those who are the issue. Just like the media is trying to convince millions every night. Only most of those millions are to afraid to stand for what they know is right. it is easier to go along and get along. This was an issue at the time of the founding and is still an issue today.

Standing and knowing the issues but refusing to be over come by them is the ability to weather the storm. In the 19th century many though that the rise of the socialist society was going to happen completely before the 20th century was even started. We are 100 yrs past that and need to deal with the devils at the gate again. Liberty is costly and I doubt I will go to my grave from old age. But I will go to my maker knowing I tried to live my life as best as possible and opposing those who hate God and humanity.

Fear is the Mind killer and apathy is it's 1st cousin. We must not stand by and do nothing as just insuring that communities can live and folks have value will be more than folks think. Holding the line and standing against corruption in protest and if need be near constant filing of actual charges against those in office will help change the tide. Also being willing to run for office (both my wife and I know that one of us will have to do that even though it is distasteful). Being willing to give of time to help get the message out and reach out to folks makes all the difference. It is how the left is trying to beat us, and about time we use the same weapons.
Absolutely the truth brother!
Depends on if you "go-bag" is going to be part of a more realistic set up that can move you at a distance. Then having a good mobile radio and possible mobile HF makes much more sense. But if you are talking about man packable then a HT is the best option. Only al lot of the tri-band HT's eat power and don't have a long battery life. Also remember that you are going to need atleast three batteries for every radio and a location that you can have a charge unti or the ability to tap into or create a 12v system (or convertor). Many folks on grab bags and the ideas behind them don't think beyond the 1st 24 hrs and that is dangerous at best. You need to be looking at a 72 hr to two week set up and that changes both resources and how you plan on storing and using them.
I think people are forgetting that President Trump obviously did not have the support of the DOJ and most likely the military. If so he could not have acted alone to declare the insurrection act. He also had to worry about his family. What we have seen from the bad actors reveals they have few limitations in enforcing there globalist agenda. You know... accidents happen. It seems like he is doing what he can under the circumstances. Fear is their weapon of choice and we may have to accept that being persecuted and possibly martyred, may become a new normal for patriots. And when I say persecuted I'm not talking about being kicked off of twitter. I dont like it but I hope I have what it takes to make that sacrifice if it is required. I love this country and pray to our lord and savior Jesus Christ for strength in our time of great trouble.
And so it begins....

I've been big into the Lithium ion 18650s for many years. They are extremely lightweight, hold their charge for long periods, take thousands of recharges and can be configured into pack sizes/voltages very easily. That was one of my must haves in shopping for my FRS units. Li-ion cannot be beat.
The ni-cads don't come close
I've been looking at small hand krank dynomos lately to supplement the small solar pack for cloudy day and night charging. There is also a very cool little generator that you drop into a running brook or river to produce juice.
On the subject of weight vs wattage, what do you feel the try to stay above range in watts should be?
I see how active you are trying to be..heres a personal and private invitation
‚ÄúCome and take them‚Äù will soon become much more than a defiant slogan.
Guru's check out this 70 to 100 watt amplifier that only weighs 0.5lbs. There are three things off the top. 1. It is critical that SWR is kept low or it will burn up. 2. It can't be fed with any more than 10 watts. 3. It is currently designed to work with only two radios but I have a hard time believing that it won't work with most any low power HAM transceiver.
We all knew it was going to happen. I'm sure the Republicrats and the citizens will do nothing. They will use the woke military if they need to.
Thanks brother. I just sent you one back. 
I wouldn‚Äôt count on the Supreme Court to faithfully interpret the Constitution.

Unfortunately you are all too correct. We have been sold out by our government, department of justice and courts.

We are on our own here and I fear that the idea of plugging away at this problem through legislation and elections will be like a fart in the wind.

It‚Äôs been tough the last few days between work and home issues. Been looking in and keeping up with the chats as time allowed. Thanks for the invite. I was actually going to let you know I will be up in Asheville for a job on the 31st.
Good morning all. Had a few tough days this week but have been keeping up with the chats as time has allowed.
Everyone has made good points and I agree we are coming towards a solution. Even though I do firmly believe all of our politicians, courts etc have let us down we will still need a public figure of some type to lead us. Trump is not the messiah and I think he would agree. He got played and outmanuvered by the looney leftists and deep staters trying to keep the status quo. Our military was not going to help him if he invoked the insurrection act, too many in leadership that are approved by Obama‚Äôs boards to achieve rank. He may have realized that and that is why he did not do it. No matter we do have to find like minded politicians that will stand up for us. Like minded sheriffs that will stand up for us. And we have to throw all support behind them and hold their feet to the fire as well lest they flip flop. In the meantime local organizing is still vital for OK right now. It has to start somewhere and let it start there at the citizen level and grow. Use this forum to bounce ideas of course but use it to network as well. I think about those camps and such all the time and try and remember my SERE training from 30+ years ago and hope I will react as needed if it comes to that and be able to assist others. But I will not lose faith so long as I am here and standing upright. For our Republic!
Good morning NC from Meck Co!
Morning all!

Good morn to all ......help a neighbor today..it feels good!
Chang observed how China seeks to sow seeds of political unrest and violence within America.

He remarked, ‚ÄúLast year, China tried to incite violence on Antifa and Black Lives Matter protesters by sending them videos via TikTok on how to riot. The Chinese military did that working out of the Houston Consulate, so there‚Äôs an attempt to overthrow the American government using race themes.‚Äù
@jpj   How secure is this DM channel between you and I?  I may have intel.
Of course seems to me text book that the Chinese would do that

Morning gundawg!
Good morning / afternoon back at you all.
Aha, I missed that. Thanks. I'm having second thoughts about cheeping out on a portable or going with a small car mobile in a comm bag. Ugh heavy. I'm going to stick with the Kenwood brand I already have for my base, TS-2000 and get the Kenwood TH-D74A. I can always get an external amp down the line if I can find one that will compliment that HT and is not too heavy. Now the big decision, new or used, What do you all recommend?
They will use this as an attempt to divide us as the Soviet deep cover spies did during the Cold War. Of all enemies the US has ever faced all of the Asian enemies have been the worst, from the Japanese to the Koreans/Chinese to the Vietnamese. That WAS taught to us in SERE school way back when
Roger that on the "oathbreaker". Most of them on the left and a handful on the right break their oath every day.
He was in the military, I think Navy, and went to either Iraq or Afghanistan so it‚Äôs extra for him. True on the left being ALL oathbreakers
Now he wants us to pay for bs with ANOTHER TAX
@ssgtgman   The good news is ham radio and gear keep their value . . . or was that the bad news? Hmmm. Point is, you won't pay much more for a new rig than you would used.
If you like that, wait for the national sales tax.
Paid that in Germany called VAT, value added tax, that why the Germans wanted to buy on base so badly
Yes just need to get more NC folks together somehow
Keeping.AZ, I hear that. A couple of used on Ebay but for the one or two hundred I might save I may end up getting a beater. Chasing problems gets expensive out of warranty.
So irritated by our military leadership. Disappointed as well. My hope is that the operators will not fall for his bs that is bound to appear. This was not done by accident I agree with Chief Kent
AFTER STRUGGLING FOR WEEKS TO GET INTO THIS CHAT FORUM I COME TO REALIZE I MIGHT BE TOO LATE! I can't seem to find anyone that is still standing up to this Tierney!  ZERO ORGANIZING?? 1 guy offers to 'meet up for a beer' when he comes thru town? Offer is much appreciated even though I have no follow up yet, BUT if that's all we got for OK-TX... WE'RE SCREWED!  I didn't join this outfit because of its wonderful shuffleboard league! I'm here because of my 8 GRANDKIDS!!! I will NOT surrender their freedom for ANYTHING!!! SO... who's in charge of TX?? where are the team leaders/area coordinators?? who's doing the vetting of the FNG's??
There was a time that I thought of trying to push for a national "VAT" tax, but my idea included abolishing income tax alltogether in the same bill. Getting the IRS out of our pockets and off of our backs while at the same time bringing tax revenue in from purchases (no matter if you were a visitor from another country or someone who makes their money let's say off the books).
Income tax is unconstitutional. However, I'd settle for VAT, as you say.
Buy NEW. Then if you need to sell it, you know you'll get most your money back. Nice, eh?
@DaveyE7   Hah! I thought you said "drone by accident." :joy:
Over in the EU they call it that. VAT=value added tax. I still think that my idea would be best but I don't think we'll ever see it here. High income earners buy expensive things so they would pay a lot more taxes as a result. The only thing is it would open up a black market like we've never seen.

True it did in Germany when Germans wanted to buy on base and sell or use. A lot of times they got items in base from a friendly GI  and sent it off to relatives of East Germany or the Eastern Bloc countries. It was a mess that has been stopped over there
He can but I hope that like his immigration EO someone will tie him up in court. Even though we cannot really trust the courts and most politicians I think short of drastic steps this is our only action at this time. Or we can hope for a nationwide awaking of ALL of our police and sheriffs to stand up for us
My two ARRL ring bound manuals arrived today. And the FRS radios.
I watched a YouTube clip yesterday from a guy who says he went from no license to extra class in one month. He was able to pass the tech & general in one sitting and then a few weeks later passed the extra. He said the first two were mostly if not all regulations and the extra was 60/40 regs and  theory. Did you find your tech to be mostly or all regs?
Media Starting to Admit Federal Prosecutors Have Scant Evidence Against January 6th DC Protestors as Judges Start Asking Questions https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2021/03/27/media-starting-to-admit-federal-prosecutors-have-scant-evidence-against-january-6th-dc-protestors-as-judges-start-asking-questions/
Well imagine that. Idiots....
6 Jan was NOT an insurrection. Anymore than all last summer were peaceful protests
There were no weapons confiscated from any of the "protesters" who were exercising their rights. No weapons equals no insurrection. Plus that part of the protest was coordinated by the left as the final piece of their plan to end the Trump administration.
And I'm sure that most of you have seen the video footage of antifuk members hiding behind bushes and changing into their pro Trump gear. If not let me know and I will post it hear.
Just sent this in to a few local papers‚Äî- let‚Äôs see if it gets published.
Regarding the recent senseless Boulder, Colorado tragedy: Some call it, ‚Äúgun violence‚Äù.  Please, let‚Äôs call it what it is: Murders perpetrated by a deranged individual.
 
Regarding the countless murders that occur everyday in cities throughout this country: Some call it, ‚Äúgun violence‚Äù. Please, let‚Äôs call it what it is: Murders perpetrated by criminals.
 
As expected, some career politicians (who are always protected by armed guards) jump into action with talk of banning weapons that look a certain way, to registration proposals, etc. The problem is you can‚Äôt legislate violence out of humanity. This is a people problem, not a gun problem. That needs be the focus, not the abrogation of the rights of law-abiding citizens.
 
Take heed, all: History is replete with examples of governments using dramatic events as pretexts to deprive good citizens of their rights ‚Äúfor the good of all‚Äù. We need guard our precious inalienable rights with courage and conviction. I shudder to think what will become of the Republic should the Second Amendment be enfeebled or fall. Whosoever keeps and bears arms is in charge. In this country, it‚Äôs supposed to be THE PEOPLE.
Btw, if there are any Ohio OKs, please find the Ohio channel‚Äî it‚Äôs #OH‚Äî go to the little globe and find us‚Äî we need to connect.
Correct, ssgtgman‚Äî that was allowed to happen‚Äî- and they got exactly what they wanted‚Äî a pretext to justify their agenda‚Äî- which has nothing to do w political ideology, btw‚Äî it‚Äôs about the oligarchy solidifying power‚Äî- pure selfish opportunism.

All excellent points and on target Redbox and ssgtgman
SR is vetting teams in each state who then vet people in their state.  It will take time.
Thanks. I just replied 
Thanks, DaveyE7. Btw, we should all have protonmail accounts (free, encrypted for real and not housed in the US; and get ham radio technician licenses. Go to ARRL.ORG.
You are probably right @DaveyE7 One hopes, and I pray you're right. However, historical precedent under such circumstances does not favor a happy ending. I'm seeing a "perfect storm" of converging elements that bodes on the truly cataclysmic. Long live the Republic!
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=caabC8KYmn9lz2BCH) Agreed. Everything about this conflict, to this point, seems to be a cyber-dominated psyops/disinformation campaign. Its on the verge of going kinetic. My view is that we're a year into WWIII, our first "4th Gen" (unrestricted) war.
Redfox, I totally agree, it's about seizing power and the "OWO" agenda.
That‚Äôs right. This is business at the highest geo-political level. Not a game, and winner takes all.
Windy, they want us to go kinetic. We gotta be smart and stay cool.
We are the good guys and gals. We‚Äôve done nothing wrong, nor have we incited anything nor hurt anyone.
We are law-abiding citizens and patriots.
They can call us what they will. We are the guardians of the Republic.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=md9p7S7Bf3BA9rEjP) I hear you, sir, but are they not crossing a line in the sand when they start busting our doors down to seize our weapons, poisoning our children, and sending freedom advocates to prison? Millions of Americans (including me) are not going to stand by and let that happen. It will go kinetic at that point, and ignite an epic chain reaction. I don't exactly how or when, but I think we're at the tipping now.
They absolutely are crossing the line‚Äî-and we may very well be past the tipping point. I see many people standing their ground and defending themselves in their homes. Let them
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=sycJWMeXTb7ELHcPC) It may just come down to that. Still not a promising a scenario
be the aggressors to which we respond‚Äî the chain reaction will ensue organically.
and I‚Äôm not so sure local law enforcement would abide unlawful orders‚Äî- they‚Äôve been alienated for the past year by oligarchy‚Äî- we don‚Äôt have a beef w them‚Äî- hell, we support them.
Sweet! Agreed
@Redfox You probably have the most practical strategy there, but I still think that what we need more than anything else is a united front among the pro-freedom/pro-Constitution "forces," such as they stand. Currently, the enemy is handing it to us. We can hope our side becomes stronger as time goes on, the zombies awaken, at which point (hopefully) the lone-wolf communities would begin to unite. At that point we could hopefully begin to turn the tide. That's a lot of hope for me to have...lol All I can say is that I am glad I'm a Believer :slight_smile:
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=ozk6QsZAmR8xQ22o5) Interesting! Probably with Biden administration help
Agree, Windy. Right now they‚Äôre on the hunt to crush ‚Äúdissenters‚Äù. When on earth did we become the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù? When they got scared of us‚Äî- we stand in their way. U see how they‚Äôre going after ‚Äúwhite supremacists‚Äù in the military? It‚Äôs because they know most in uniform do not like what they see.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=RRjvqQ3fzL6rSs4Kp) Most definitely with Biden and the Left's help
The ‚Äúwhite supremacist insurrectionist‚Äù is the boogey-man that has to be eradicated. A complete fabrication.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=rwmcwdCALbwwwH6PJ) Yes, exactly! I never thought this counselor "church lady" and former soccer mom would ever be accused of being a dangerous right-wing extremist. Its insane! They're forcing us to accept their gaslighting of us as criminals. BUT ITS THEM who are the criminals. Still, that's some pretty powerful brainwashing for them to be getting away with, isn't it? At least its not a boring time in history we're living through...lol
That‚Äôs right. Hitler would be proud of how they‚Äôre pulling this off‚Äî- they are following his playbook perfectly.
Make the true patriots the enemy. Not everyone, though, is fooled.

This is from a text forwarded by a friend:
@Keeping.AZ no single person can stand up to confiscation.  There are videos on youtube of folks trying to follow CA law getting their weapons confiscated.  The bad actors show up in force and usually at 0dark30 and use overwhelming force such that if one were to even reach a weapon it would be over before it started.
jpj, thanks for the reply. how much time do you think we have left before this all becomes a moot point?? ive been waiting for a few months now! heck i still haven't received my Liberty Tree membership pkg?? i can 'appreciate' the 'need' for detailed vetting to say the least! i know there are several long time (SR trusted) OK'rs near Houston & all im trying to do is get my stuff right so the people in my community that are counting on me to do just that are set for whatever comes our way!

They don‚Äôt have enough Commie Personnel to go door to door to confiscate our guns  , first of all who would want that job? It would be more Hazardous than a night mission in Afghanistan!  After the first day the number of deaths in Neighborhoods would undoubtedly force the illegitimate President to Stand down his Brown Shirt Task Force, if they  wouldn‚Äôt have on their own! So we have to be prepared for the unknown, it might be cancelled Bank accounts, Electricity interruptions or something of that nature to try and force people to basically give in and turn over their weapons so they don‚Äôt unwillingly punish their Family members..  Me myself nothing they do will force my hand because once we submit it‚Äôs Game Over!! So be Prepared! Save cash!!! Stock up on essentials!!  And remember we have God on our side!üí™üá∫üá∏
I read somewhere that it is believed that the vast majority would comply. I agree with that statement.
True I do not trust our courts at all and your ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù analogy is spot on. There was another comment somewhere about following Hitlers playbook, well they are following a dictorial playbook alright. I have some hope our police and sheriffs will not comply based on events of the last year. I do know with the mask mandate by our idiotic governor here in NC the local police talked amongst themselves and said no way were they gonna enforce it which was encouraging. That was insider information from a regular on the street cop. Only time will tell if our Republic survives! We do know communism does not survive!
Good morning NC!
Good morning all caught up on the conversation from last night. Great stuff! Our minds are sharp and on point and hopefully our greatest fears will not come true. My dad who is very religious now in his later years says to me always when we discuss these things swirling around us to trust Gods plan, that he and my stepmom do and that‚Äôs all they can do. I simply worry for the future of my child and my stepchildren and grandchildren is all, I do hope he is right! 
He is

@denbo I know that SR and the national team are working hard on getting us back to normal operations.  It has been difficult.  Our credit card processor dropped us about the same our former hosting provider shut us down.  It has been a mad dash to just keep the lines of communications open with our membership.
Good morning Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea!
Back at you jpj.
jpj, A little mix up from buytwowayradios.com they must have retrieved my order and corrected it. Yesterday I received one pair of frs radios and the 7-band / dual-band HT. So if you still want to do a test let me know.
Practicing emergency medical suturing my dogs stuffed elephant. ;^)
Cool. For the time being I'm going to sit on this intel.
No. The exams are a mix of topics. You'll see the categories in your study guides. Eight topics, I think. 

Study will depend much on how much background you have with electronics. Changing light bulbs was about the extent of my electromagnetic background. :laughing:   

Some test takers will simply practice and memorize test questions and answers. 

For me, I've always approached learning from the ground up. I insist on understanding what's going on, fundamentally. Theory and practice. When I learn a new topic, I learn everything from the molecular level up to geomagnetics.  When I pass a test, I want to know it's because I truly understand the material, not just because I've memorized the answers.
@ssgtgman   Doctor Sergeant.
_I read somewhere that it is believed that the vast majority would comply [with gun confiscation]. I agree with that statement._  -- @gre81 

I'm afraid I have to agree. I think a surprising number of Americans would comply with a "buy back," aka gun confiscation. Before kicking down doors, the feds will put financial pressure on gun owners to comply, e.g. revoke SSN, revoke drivers license, revoke SSA and unemployment benefits, revoke commercial flight, business licenses, employment eligibility, access to credit and banking, deny interstate travel, internet access, etc.  Many of these "privileges" are regulated by federal agencies: SSA, IRS, FCC, FAA, FDIC, etc.
No medical training but I will do what's needed to stop the bleeding, or "create" it ;^)
Air goes in and out, and blood goes 'round and 'round. That's all you need to know. So said my EMT instructor.
hog rings!
On the gun confiscation, I think that's all the more reason for "Casper" guns, and well buried away out of their reach.
Hog rings work. Get out the old upholstery kit...
If your trauma kit doesn't help your patient's air go "in and out" and his/her blood go "'round and 'round," you're not building a trauma kit---you're building a boo-boo bag.  The purpose of a trauma kit is to keep your patient ALIVE until they get to the hospital.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=WB6bfdYZstmGP9Knd)  I do hope so. I am not as religious as he is but have never strayed too far from faith. No atheists in a foxhole or combat zone 
The antifa/blm types are just now realizing that the left had all along been using them as pawns: "The danger of this shows that the State is willing to designate any and all social movements and groups from below and to the Left as "extremist," with support and participation in them creating 'justification' for repression, harassment, and surveillance." https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20530912/download.pdf
Why the hell are we in there as home grown extremists? Unreal....
Because they on the left are going to use any reason they can to take your guns
I always get a kick out of 2A websites, articles, and FB videos teaching clever ways gun owners can hide their firearms when the feds come to confiscate.  

You see, the whole idea behind 2A is NOT to avoid having your gun collection seized, but to USE your firearms to defend your right to own them.  In other words USE your guns, don't hide them.  

When do I have to start shooting? Well . . . right about the time you have to hide them.
I am swamped the next few weeks.
We must take the cue from the men who stood on Lexington Green.  We must band together in organized local groups and be prepared to keep bad actors out of our small towns and counties.  The large cities are of no moment if it comes to gun confiscation.  The large cites have very few arms and most in the large cities would either be handed over quickly or be quickly dealt with by overwhelming force since there are not enough armed citizens in the big cities to make a stand.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=6Fp5fk5B5YPgQudaJ) Because they have to kill Oathkeepers in the court of public opinion before they can kill Oathkeepers in reality.
All good. I was thinking that I was going to have two different pairs of 2watt units to test out. But as I said now just the one pair. So maybe we can connect down the line later in April. I will be in CT for Easter and can do some rural testing there with my two son in laws. In the meantime I  will be studying and hope to have my HAM license by the time we connect.
Keeping.AZ, I fully understand your point but to go head to head against overwhelming forces and putting your loved ones lives in jeopardy because we didn't follow the "7Ps".  Look at it this way, if they come to your door and take two of your guns and you're a live and not locked up to make a move with planning and support we will be in a much better place.

They are adding political commissars to the US military. People need to wake up, it gets way worse from here out.

Yes, employment as a gun confiscator will be dangerous work. Many though will gladly take those jobs, particularly during an economic downturn. 

They aren't dumb though. There are many ways to minimize the hazards. Do NOT expect confiscators to pull up to your castle and knock on your front door, or bust in at 3am for a no-knock raid.  Nope.  First they'll grab YOU and detain YOU. Once YOU are secured, they'll raid your home at their leisure.  

They'll grab YOU when you least expect it:  returning to your car after church service, while you're paying for groceries at the market, when you're in your car in line waiting to pick up your middle schooler, arriving at the movie theater with your date, at UPS dropping off an Amazon return package, etc. Once YOU are out of the way, on-the-job hazards are greatly reduced.
I agree with all especially ssgtgman. Each one of us has to decide what we will do at that moment. It‚Äôs like the Code of Conduct says in one part ‚ÄúI will never surrender myself or my men while we have the means to resist.‚Äù Well if you have weapons with 1-2 rounds each man and are surrounded do you still have the means to resist? We armed Aircrew with handguns for survival use not to be a Rambo type behind enemy lines. You can resist while a prisoner it‚Äôs just more of a mental game is all. POW‚Äôs have done it in all wars especially when face with an Asian enemy. Guess what, we may be going round 2 with the Chinese! So we will all be better off organized at the local level and maybe we can help defend each other better.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=aNZhC5oh7Z45psQZD) I agree!
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=KERW9YAq8kPnrKAwu) I think you're right. They've complied with everything else. Why not gun confiscation?
Just my opinion, but I say, at this point, the more guns and ammo we have flowing in this country, the better off its going to be. Like Switzerland, every man and woman should be armed and fully trained to defend themselves against exactly the kind of tyrannical threats we now face here on American soil. AMERICANS, DO NOT COMPLY

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=NmXSEm5yz28G8C7dg) Of course, you make a very good point @ssgtgman . Each patriot will have to weigh the risk and rewards.  A wife and husband with a young family to feed has MUCH to consider, much at stake, so they may take a stand that best fits their present circumstances.  Many of us will decide, live to fight another day, and indeed make a tremendous contribution to the restoration of liberty at a more opportune time.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=rGk4Wh9q7qbFRP26y) And when, sir, would that "more opportune time" be? Just curious.
@windy that really depends.  Each fight must be approached differently.  The battle of Long Island was not the right time for Washington.  The battle on Christmas was.  That is not a question that can be answered now.
What we must answer now is how to organize, what political and PR moves we must make.  Yes PR and Politics will have to be part of the equation.  I am not a special operator, but we need to use the tactics of our SF folks to use the middle of the road and not paying attention people as force multipliers.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=7SuXi4CjuSXzyDg6o) We will never win on the battlefield of PR and politics. Never. They have the home field advantage and all the refs are in their pocket.
We need to set up our own alert system. They will never have the numbers to hit many of us at any given time. So you give, you live, you alert! Take your guns and move out and team up. What is taken can be taken back and multiplied. Take their guns and ammo to. We need to plan ahead.

We have this chat but we all know how easily they can cut this comm line. We need a real deal alert system put in place ASAP or sooner! Contact numbers, radio call signs and pre- designated emergency frequencies that if the "go" signal is received switch to the emergency frequency.

Unfortunately that will not happen because they own all of the media outlets, so when someone is unjustly killed in the coming "no knock" raids the media/feds will label them pedophiles or CP hoarders and everyone will just agree they got what they deserve. Our enemies are as deceptive as they are ruthless, think like they do.
jpj,  I agree that the political path must continue in the unlikely event it works. But if we don't work the "7Ps" and in a hurry they are going to be eating our lunch!
For the non military, 7Ps = proper prior planning prevents piss poor performance.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=4pWCYStBXTjRhF52x) Look at the recent case in FL where the 2 FBI agents were "killed" - Since when do the FBI raid someone with a tank/swat team over "CP"... Since when do CP purveyors get into shootouts with the FBI and kill 2 members of a highly trained FBI swat team??? They fucking don't. It doesn't fit the MO and the cover story was obvious bullshit.
We can compartmentalize our Emergency contact info into grids, states or regions. Not giving out too much info to any one segment or person for OPSEC.

The good news is that many people see what is happening. We are not alone by any means, in fact we are the majority. Just prepare to protect your families and home, when the time comes, if it comes, you'll know.
Oh for fuck sake.
__[Patrick] Henry was convinced that war was around the corner, and he arrived at the Virginia Convention determined to persuade his fellow delegates to adopt a defensive stance against Great Britain. On March 23, he put forward a resolution proposing that Virginia‚Äôs counties raise militiamen ‚Äúto secure our inestimable rights and liberties, from those further violations with which they are threatened‚Äù_  

_During the Stamp Act controversy in 1765, he [Patrick Henry] had even flirted with treason in a speech in which he hinted that King George risked suffering the same fate as Julius Caesar if he maintained his oppressive policies.  (Evan Andrews, History.com)__

Patrick Henry wasn't interested in winning PR. He was interested in LIBERTY.  He let God take care of the PR.
I do not want "diversity" in our special operators.  I want operators who are strong, smart, and resourceful.  I could give a shit about anything else.  If they are all purple with tits that works for me as long as they can do the job.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=ih8AYJmyNkKoAoCrD) This is all a ruse, they are AGAIN planning to purge/deplete/destroy the military before purposely starting a war with either China/Russia in which we are destined to lose. The only way to kill America is from within.
Henry's words were widely circulated using the blog of the time, which were pamphlets.

jpj, do you mean division?
No he means diversity.It is a type of division done under another name and for slightly different ends
Though for most folks it means the same.
No I mean diversity.  When you chose soldiers by making sure there are women in a speciality that requires brawn  that is not good.  When I was in school there was only one woman in my class that could have carried me off the battle field.
Like inclusion kind of diversity
Marxist always disguise their plans in clever buzzwords like "diversity" 
In this case diversity means to purge those that aren't on board with the globalist destruction of America.
If you want a good fighting force you put people in jobs based on ability in that job not diversity quotas.
The military ain't no place for gender experiments
Trust me you do not want me doing neck adjustments, unless you are looking for fatal adjustment.  chiroeurope is the man for that!
@chiroeurope are you still able to work or has your own health issues put an end to your being an active health care professional?
Then again once we are back in the US I am a threat with a single fire arm on my property. I own multiple 3D printers. The understanding and experience in casting metal and a gantry CNC that can handle most forms of aluminum that are worth having. Shortly after that I will be converting a couple of lathes and mills to CNC for farm use and business use. To the tyrant that is as dangerous if not more dangerous then the person who has weapons. The other issue is that during my premed classes there was a year of organic chemistry and 6 yrs in the Corp of ENG. Add to that fact that I have done political organizing and PR set up and am married to a woman who has done graphics on the professional level and the political area and things get interesting.
@chiroeurope hope you land near my backwoods retreat!
JPJ I can work just need to get away from the UK and rapeseed/canola plants. As that is what gives me the greatest issues. I will be getting new C5 screws for the two axi' that need them for my gantry router which will give it about a 0.08mm tolerance and repeatability.
Hope you get home soon!
That and about $1K in endmills and other tooling.
JPJ how many folks you know keep their squares in boxes with silica bags in order to not have to worry about them losing the calibration they are set to???
So do I, working on finishing the instructional manual for the antenna and will be putting that up on QRZ and a few homeschool groups. Also IF anyone know other groups, like a 3% group that would benefit from the design please let me know.
Just in from a friend that escaped the USSR.   "The USA now looks like the USSR."
A fellow full permit holder has also put a bee in my bonnet and working ona multi band dipole array that is part active and part passive array. That should with an ATU be able to handle from 70 cm to 20M possibly 40m. This issue is getting it to balance and this will be an FM array. As trying this for SSB would be a bit of a nightmare.
I live an area of the UK that is a Soviet Socialist State run by National Socialists. Who have the populace so drugged on the hate of the English and London they don't even realize that they are selling themselves into slavery.
FM not allowed below 29.5 Mhz with any useful deviation.
Antennas do not care about the mode of modulation.
Physics dictates that the same Antenna Matching Unit can not handle 7Mhz as 440Mhz.
Like I said in an earlier post I have had offers for Panama, Chile, a few of the Island nations, WA in OZ. It is not worth it IF the one nation that was holding the line is destroyed, then it will all go ti shit and life will be a game of one step ahead of the anti- family, anti-Christian groups and that is no life for my kids.
At VHF/UHF  adjustable matching unites are not really needed because there are plenty of good broadband designs and the losses of an AMU would be less than optimal.
Omni unity gain from 50 Mhz up the discone is proven and easy to make.  Maintains impedence across the range.
True but the Antenaa is to allow the areas of FM that are usable 10 to 70 cm to be used. In the UK we still have an active 40m FM band that is used often. Last I knew the US had one as well, unless that has dried up lately.
Directional the Log Periodic has the same advantage.  Maintains the impedance constant over a wide range of Freq and has good gain and back/side rejection.
This is a bit broader band then discone as they tend to be narrow tune only.
LPA are very useful
Just very heavy
You and I must have a different idea of narrow.  My discone is good from 50Mhz to 2.5Ghz.
The US has not allowed FM below 29.5 Mhz for the last 40 years.
The mutli-band is a n idea brewing not right now practical and would require different diameter elements to get the best per band and that is going to take time to test. Which would be more for folks looking for a single antenna group over an array
Well technically you can do it, but bandwidth must be the same as a SSB signal which makes the S/N ratio crap and makes it unusable.  In addition there exists little or no equipment for FM at lower freqs.
Within each band they tend to have and area where they receive and transmit well and out side of the section of the band not so much. Ye they cover multiple bands but each band tends to have asweet spot for usage over what i am trying for which is sub 1.5 (preferably 1.4) SWR across an entire band width.
There are discone that will do that but they also require multiple different diameter elements and get heavy fast.
I do not want to call you out in public, but I strongly suggest you have a look at "The Radio Handbook" by William Orr.  Especially the chapters on transmission lines and antennas.  The ARRL Antenna Book is also good.  Much of what you are saying in the chat reminds me of things I would say when I was starting in the field before I applied myself and learned the theory.
You are gung ho and I love that.
Try to learn from the science already documented and build on it instead of re-inventing the wheel.
5:5 jpj - idling w/ no fwd tacplan isn't my strong suit
The operators probably will see through this bs as I said yesterday. But there are plenty of support troops that may or may not....and any commanding officer over O5 cannot be trusted unless they prove themselves. 
And besides go ahead and piss off the operators, go ahead and watch them leave and come over to our side. You know that will happen
I'm getting your comms in my email but I can't find them in my ok chat. New to it so here we are. I think it's fair to say that you and I are on the same page. I'm afraid that the leadership here though noble in their attempts to garner favor through humanitarian relief projects (which never get covered by the MSM) and their long game approach through political avenues are not doing what needs to be done to prepare. As the old saying goes "hope for the best but prepare for the worst".

Yes bravo-echo that appears to be true. He is not off base at all
Great minds think alike ssgtgman! I am afraid my SERE skills may get put to use. I have been reviewing things in my mind going back 30+ years to SERE school and the 2 day POW camp session. I think leadership is doing what they can and dealing with a shit storm right now. Local organizing we must do, and the time may come soon to show if Molon Labe means what it means to people.
And I switched to the rocket chat app instead of on browser so it runs a bit differently
I will be booking up with at least 2 NC OKers here this week so I am putting my money where my mouth is about getting organized
The app, that must be it. I've only been with the OKers a couple of months. I live in the communist state of Mass. There has not been any com from anyone anywhere in New England as far as I can tell. I've put feelers out on the chat in PA, MA, NH & ME, crickets. But I hit on the subject of an internal OKers alert system to get the word out if and when the gun confiscations start. And we as a group should have backup plans in order. IDK.
Where in Mass? I am a native born Masshole. Left when I went in the military and never really have gone back but a few times to visit. My folks all moved out also long time ago
This and the Florida bill are excellent bills. All states need to begin to wrest away the totalitarian power of the Federal Government.

For those who saw my last message about the Toros Copolla T4 clone of the Benelli M4, I have finished my evaluation of the model I purchased and I am quite impressed. Here is what I found: (1) The BEST thing about this shotgun is that it seems as reliable as a typical benelli. After the factory recommended 25rd break-in period (using "maximum" loaded buckshot, it fed the cheap Monarch Dove loads as well as the Winchester Super Target ammo with no trouble.  For a shotgun I got for under 800 bucks, that's damn good. (2) The WORST thing about the shotgun is that it will NOT accept a Benelli or aftermarket +2 extension tube for the magazine. This is apparently an effort my the companies to thwart 922(r) scofflaws and ensure future importability of the shotguns. However, they WILL accept full aftermarket magazine tubes (at least from DMW), so you can still get to 7+1 with this particular weapon. (3) Due to the ongoing ammo crisis, I did not get a chance to test a wide variety of ammo. I did have problems with Winchester Ranger low recoil slugs. When they say "low recoil" on the box, they are not kidding. To be fair: the Benelli M2 we tested alongside it for comparison did not like those slugs either. We did not get a change to test Winchester white box (Wal-Mart crap) but I know from prior experience that most autoloaders hate that ammo. I do not consider this a drawback: The Remington "SureShot Dove" has always performed superbly in my guns. This gun loved the Monarch Dove Ammo (which boasted a 1300fps+ speed) and could be had for 60 - 70 a case last season (I doubt we see it for less than 160 - 170 this season). My advice with this and any other semi-auto shotgun is to learn what ammo it likes and use that ammo. (4) The finish is not going to be Benelli quality. A friend who test fired it complained that the edges on the receiver "dug into" his hand during high recoil loads. I told him to suck up it. (5) Of course, the fit and finish could not have been THAT bad. I bought a Mesa Tactical side saddle to put in this because I wanted to see if the screw holes lined up with the M4 on the rail. They did so without a hitch.  So far, I can say that it will take more effort to get this to 7+1 than with a true Benelli. However, you are still going to be paying substantially less for effectively the same gun. I do not care if the gun says "Benelli" - so long as what I am shooting at with it takes the same dirt nap.
Shame this channel is a bone yard. We need to get together and have face to face meets.

Glad it's moving again.  Only one question.  Whenever you see the ship's name in the news, it is "Ever Given", but the name painted on the ship is "Evergreen".  Wonder why?
Ever Given is leased to Evergreen Line from Luster Maritime/Higaki Sangyo, owner. Evergreen Line is the common trading name for the Evergreen Group's container shipping companies that comprise Evergreen Marine Corp.

This one was detained then released. https://mobile.twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1376313345423372288
Yeah, I thought so.  The time also always reads "1 minute ago".
still stuck guys - look on the right-side of the page shows vessel speed @ 0.0 also position has not changed since link posting. too many tugs clustering as well, if she was floating you'd see max 3-4 tugs engaged, instead of the 4 ocean tugs/3 port tugs arrangement (should add if she was underway all tugs would release-maybe retaining 1 bow & 1 stern assist)
After the initial de-wedging, I had predicted on Telegram that they was gonna get it re-stuck because they insist on pulling the bow away from and pushing the stern toward the eastern bank instead of pulling the thing straight back. What I believe they've done is levered a huge gob of mud and rock into the channel and ruptured the hull further than the initial collision causing it to sink further. There was just a tweet from an Egyptian observer there that it's "refloated successfully but the bow section is still hung up on the eastern bank" and another tweet earlier that said they were running bilge pumps to evacuate the water coming in from  the "breech". The final part of my prediction was that it was going to tip over rendering the canal useless for the next year but we'll have to wait till tomorrow to see if I'm correct on that part, though there are recent pictures showing a slight list to port.
You have to refresh the screen (second icon up from the bottom left pane) every minute or so to see movement... like watching paint dry.

According to DARPA, patriots, white advocates, Christians, and "anti-feminists" all qualify as extremists subject to punishment and expulsion. Anarchists, environmentalists, animal welfare activists -- but not Black Lives Matter -- are also on the list.
The guidelines describe patriot "domestic extremists" as holding an ideology that states "the US government has become corrupt, has overstepped its constitutional boundaries or is no longer capable of protecting the people against foreign threats." Oathkeepers, Proud Boys and Boogaloo Bois are put in this category.
jpj, I was just digging through my old comm bag looking for the chargers for my UV-5Rs to keep them charged up for SHTF. Guess what I found? I had a pair of Midland LXT500 FRS radios that I had completely forgotten about. I checked the specs online and they are 22 channel & claiming 2watts. So we will have two pair to evaluate after all.

I love that granger actually publishes the full specs in an easy to find and view format.  I am still trying to get an easy to view matrix on the motorola talkabout radios.  Some of them are FRS, but some are "crippled gmrs".  Crippled in that they can not make use of repeaters, but they are gmrs because they are more than 2 watts.  I plan to get a pair of floating FRS radios since I spend much time around the water.  I might get floating GMRS, but have not decided if I want to pony up $35 for a license when it seems I can not put up a repeater due to lack of type accepted equipment.
My wife is from Tewksbury, born in Main but grew up in Tewksbury.
Hmmmm granger lists them as digital with no analog.  Probably not good.  Analog FM has greater reliable range and of course it is the lowest common denominator.
I didn't notice that on the digital. Good eye. The other pair that I thought were coming from buytwowayradios.com was the Dewalt DXFRS800  https://www.grainger.com/product/DEWALT-Handheld-Portable-Two-Way-55GZ36
Lol very small world. 
Seems if one puts the right stuff into the grainger site you get a nice table of all their radios - frs/gmrs/murs/marine/air/part-90 (vhf or uhf commercial).  Had no idea grainger sold in all those markets!  Their chart will help me decide on my next FRS pair and also what to suggest for OK as a baseline.
Yes great site too bad their so expensive. But useful as you've stated.
I narrowed search to FRS/GMRS.  It seems all the lower priced motorola units are .4 or .5 watts.  So for higher power at reasonable price motorola is out.
She lived on Marshall st
Unidin and Cobra are all good brands with a long history making quality CB equipment, so I would trust them even at lower prices.
Looks like they are closing out some cobra 1/2 watt units for $8.19!
They say 22 ch.  At $8.19 you really can not go wrong as extras.
Yes true. I thought the Dewalt were floating but I think only IP67 but they do have the best drop rating. You could throw it at antifa & blm and it would still work ;^)
Why the hell is it just us old guys who are retired or should be that are on top of trying to save the republic?  I am down to go with an antifa or BLM if need be, but where are the younger stronger men?
This is a good price for a repeater capable mobile unit - https://www.grainger.com/product/MIDLAND-Mobile-Two-Way-Radio-54HR51
15 watts will give plenty of range.  Sadly as I said repeaters, not so much.
I don't know about the age groups or numbers we do or do not have. Your privy to that info. Society has gone to hell, no respect, no morality, no religion no patriotism. The left, the colleges and the MSM & SM have brainwashed the public.
I'm kind of surprised that after our talks and your views on FRS that you are looking to GMRS.
Plus the $35 is for 10 years
FRS is the lowest common denominator.  Everyone in OK should have FRS capability.  My anti GMRS is from the point of view of not wanting masses of our people to either operate illegally without a license or get on the Gov radar with a license.  GMRS interoperates with FRS fine.  I already have both a Ham ticket and a Commercial ticket, so I am already on the Gov radar.
My one reason for considering GMRS is to build a portable repeater.  Not sure if that is even possible with current equipment offerings.  The heavy GMRS users, mostly out in the country away from cities, are pissed that the FCC no longer allows part-90 radios on GMRS.  They used to use PART-90 repeaters set to the GMRS channels.  They no longer can.
I read through the part 95 or 97? And the one thing that stuck out to me was that the GMRS clearly stated was illegal to use against the government, if it came to that we would be breaking laws anyway but I thought that may have had something to do with your point of view.
Part 95 is GMRS/MURS/CB
There will be a long time between now and when we are totally lawless, so my push for FRS as the base is to keep us from losing troops to the FBI taking in folks for radio violations.  Radio violations are generally fines, often huge, but there are prison terms in the regs.
FCC is watching FCC/GMRS/FRS/MURS.  They put out a "warning" to all users of those services before the Jan 6 events to not use radio for illegal purposes.  Why put out the warning if they were not going to try and round up folks on radio violations.
The other thing I tried to find was if you on GMRS, knowing it covers all 22 FRS channels I hoped to find that if you kept your power output to FRS levels would you not still be required to give your call sign. But I found no such thing.
By putting out the warning they could say not only is it in the rules, but we made a special public announcement.
In general if you are using a GMRS radio you will have to identify per the GMRS rules no matter the power level.  The radio does not magically become FRS by keeping power to 1/2 or 2 watts depending on channel.
BTW take the stuff the chiro in the UK says with a grain of salt.  He may have gotten his UK license, but I can tell he is not long in the tooth with radio.  He is weak on both regs and theory.  Some of his ideas are "out there".
Right that's what I determined because I could find only the language stating the requirements to announce your call sign
lol. Yes the US regs are unique and all we need concern ourselves with unless we plan on sailing the seven seas
If you're going for a GMRS for the vehicle why not go for the full limit of 50 watts
Because I am broke.  Worked 3 months in the last 18.
$140/week UI because I do not qualify for covid give away
Monthly expenses in excess of $2K with house payments
15 watts is a good power level on UHF.  If I had the funds and was going GMRS I would probably go for a 50 watt mobile in each car, and one at my home.  Do not have the money.  Have tons of ham gear that can do the same thing, but wife refuses to get license for the past 20 years.
Suffered cell outage after a storm last summer and she was like "I guess I should get my license".  I said yep, but after the cell system came back on it was out of her head again.
I was on Windham Rd when we lived in Tewksbury 
I‚Äôll be driving my small white van with a company magnet on the left side, OK sticker on the front 
A lot of HAMS end up with much more than needed. Can you sell something off and go for the twin 50s. Plus I think the one 35 dollar GMRS license covers you both. And if not it's only once every 10 years
License price is not the issue.
Most of my ham gear is in excess of 20 years old.  Not worth selling.
Back to one other point you made. I don't believe that we have as long as you think till SHTF. They are going for the gun grab sooner than you'd imagine and that is going start the shit show
Perhaps.  I predict legal battles on that first.
BTW the fellow you tangled with me I am not sure he would have walked away.
Not as strong as I used to be, but still s stuborn fuck.
Yes but mr "Executive Order" and his dipshit Attorney general are going to move first and go to court later. And the response of our brothers and sisters needs to be tempered so that their lives and freedom are kept in tact. You saw what KAZ was saying yesterday. That is a loose loose proposition. Live and remain free to fight on our own terms.
My usually technique is to get a strangle hold on them if I can get my hands on them.
I agree
Look if you are looking for a fighting force look at the lightfoot militia.  They have units in loads of places.  They are serious about being militia, and they are properly organized.  OK is not a militia and never will be from what I can see.  That is fine.  The OK mission is important and needs to happen, but for it to happen OK needs to stay out of the Militia biz.
I would be surprised if there is no lightfoot near you.
I'm 60 215 on a good day when my 8 herniated discs are not biting me in the ass I am 5'7". I just had hip surgery last year. This punk was less than half my age and at least 6'2" 190. Winning the fight and learning a lesson on head buts without getting a broken nose, I think I'm satisfied. ;^)
Do you have any contacts with them. You probably read my reply to Moonshine this morning about being disheartened.

I did not see that message.  I can not keep up with it all.
I have no contacts, but if you google them you will be able to find the nearest group.  The nearest to me in NYC is in the Albany area.
I of course can not join them because I am a disarmed NYC resident.
I saw a youtube video about them by some german tv outlet.  That is how I came to know about them.
Also on the OK front things are really in scramble/regroup mode.  The deplatform and the bullshit lies out of DC re jan 6 cost us in both members and state leaders.  If you think I am a quality fellow then just hang in there.  We are working as fast as we can to regroup and rebuild.
We have to take things somewhat slower than we would want because SR wants deep vetting on all full members to make sure we do not have bad actors.
The chat I refer to was @ 7:39 7:49 on General
I am 5'8" 175 lbs in pretty good shape, but lacking upper body strength as I always have.  Very powerful legs, but recent foot issues have me lame at the moment.
Redfox, They are scared of us because they know we are determined to uphold the constitution at any cost. How do they know ....... The revolutionary war. We as Americans stood up to defend our country and way of life, and they know we will do it again. Thanks to the Militia Men who showed up in large numbers to defend our country. We are those men and women.
Ok saw it
I need to get down to 185 195.
Just hang in there.  For years I was the only in NYC.  The rest of the NYC crew went STUPID, then left.
Now I know of 2 in NYC.  One of which has kept in regular touch.  I will be meeting him face to face probably Saturday and we will begin rebuilding NYC.  You might have to build up your state if there is no one else being active in it.
I suspect some do not know we are back because big providers are blocking our email.
Others I fear have crawled under their beds when the feds started targeting us.
My attorney advised to distance and disavow.  I said FUCK YOU PUSSY.
Grab the book Alternate Day Diet from amazon or your local book seller.  I used that to drop and keep off 50 lbs.
I'm more than willing to be part of New Hampshire but I can't get shit out of them either.
Where in Mass?
TimmytheGreek, I have an answer to the power outage. Make a lead blanket to slip over your power meter completely. This will block them from shutting off your meter through the satellite connection.
Winthrop next to Logan Airport
Damn almost as bad as where I am.  Only Boston would be worse.
You retired from the service, or discharged before 20?
Medical out with nearly 12 years. I got F-d up in Iraq
100% va and SSDI plus my elevator pension
elevator pension?
Most of my buddies that were in gulf war 1 got fucked up.
Have too many high bills though
I avoided it by getting in a car accident that made it so I could not walk 3 weeks before I got recalled to active duty.  I was pissed.  I wanted to go.
Buddy that went eventually used that single activation to springboard himself to O6 with 20 years and never set foot on a ship.  Unheard of, but he managed 20 years as a USN officer without ever having sea duty.
He is now sitting pretty
I'll bet he is!
I was an elevator mechanic for 25 years.
Well that job has it's ups and downs!
I haven't heard that one before lol
The lightfoot militia is no where near me if their map is current.
That is sad.
Wish I could retire.  WTC attack tanked my business took all my savings to that time and I have not been able to recover.  61 here.
I'l shoot him a message
Gundawg, I agree. Seems the OK chat has really suffered. I invite you to add the telegram channel I started in case this gets shut down again.
I hear that. I bought a 36' RV (Cummins diesel pusher) the week before I retired. The homefront had been on the rocks for a long time and I was planning to pull a "Gilligan" but instead of a 5 hour tour I was planning a 5 year tour. Great Lakes, the NorthWest and Yukon Territories of Canada's outback, Alaska, British Columbia on down to the Redwood Forest, that's far enough into Cali for my liking so then Eastward bouncing about the Northern border states and after that wherever. But I had to finish up a few home projects before taking off and I tore my left hip. The VA milked me along for over 7 months to the point where I finally went outside to a private specialist and got it repaired. I was doing better wrapping up the to do list and 5 weeks ago in the icey weather I slipped in my driveway up 3 feet and got a high ankle sprain. I swear she has a voodoo doll of me. Whenever I get going good, bang I'm down again!
What was the business you lost?
Columbia here.
Been dealing with health issues and business issues to get the move done. One doesn't due well with stress and the other causes it, so a bit of fun playing a balancing game. Right now going to a bit quite as need to get things done and that requires focus on the goals. While helping here is important, if I don't get the move done and the goals taken care of very shortly i will be having to look at many different options that I don't like.

I will leave messages here in this chat when i can on how I am doing and how things are going. God Bless and take care.
went to a meeting last night with Senator Bouchard in it. Man that guy is a total buffoon. He quotes laws he has no idea of, he states false information and he is no better than Cheney
actually there is a better way
it is called a faraday cage
went to a meeting last night with Senator Bouchard in it. Man that guy is a total buffoon. He quotes laws he has no idea of, he states false information and he is no better than Cheney. This idiod stated that you dont have a right to carry in Wyoming and those of you believing your 2nd amendment covers that you are dead wrong. He went on to say that the Sheriff of any county is not the highest law enforcement official and that the Govt can come in anytime they want regardless of what a sheriff says. He went on to say that a Governor can remove a sheriff, I told him that no only the voters can or in the case where the sheriff has commited a felony can they be removed. ( I was looking to run for Sheriff in Laramie County) . He told me I was wrong. I said ok given your same stupid argument you could be removed by the Governor too, he said yes. I told him you are so misinformed it is terrible becasue the Governor cannot remove you from office Senator only your voters can. That seperation of powers is what keeps the Government rolling. If the Governor could remove senators at will or Sheriffs it would be done regularly.
This guy is a F'ing nightmare and no bettter then Cheney
Good evening
Good evening Wi. Patriots. Stay vigilant my friends
I had a computer consulting business.  I consulted to financial firms on high end, highly secure, high performance systems.  All my clients were in the world trade center.
That's harsh, I'm sorry Brother.
Life sure can lob us some serious curve balls.
Senator Bouchard looks like a slimy used car salesman. Apologies to any OKers in used car sales.
i can help with tech infra, it's what I do for a living. I'm in
I'm in CT, moved here last year from NY
let me know what you need and where you are in terms of a roadmap?
i am here in
Don‚Äôt be disheartened, All, at the low participation on this site. People are nervous. Will take time to re-emerge. OK is on the radar, and I have no doubt this site is under surveillance. We‚Äôve done nothing wrong. I know that matters not, but, whilst the Republic stands, I‚Äôll say my peace and opine as I please.
If there are any OKs from the great state of Ohio, please go to the globe at the top and find the Ohio chat room. Join in!
Hi James. I'm Krissy, down in Pueblo, Colorado. Thanks for sharing that bit of your exchange with that clown, Bouchard. That's insane that he is behaving in that way! With such ignorance (or more likely, feigned stupidity) is it any wonder that we've reached the point of total social and economic collapse? I am like you in that I am looking for some source of support and/or strategy to protect myself, legally, from the coming assault on our last remaining  Constitutional rights, and had thoughts of trying to work with our Sheriff here in Pueblo County to that effect, but I'm new here and in dire need of advice on how to approach it. 

I am shocked to hear such a previously strong conservative state like Wyoming is going down the commie tubes with the rest of them. Unbelievable! But then again, after the events of the past year, should anything surprise us anymore? Of course, Colorado has long been a solid communist-puppet state, where I've found zero support from anyone, and am trying to leave as soon as I can figure out where the last bastion(s) of freedom may be in this country. It seems to be a pretty narrow list, and down to South Dakota vs. Florida.

In the meantime, if the spirit moves, feel free to connect with me via DM, as I am trying to network with as many regional patriots as possible, to coordinate on a long-term defensive strategy. The name of the game is "strength in numbers," and right now, its just little old me versus the whole Colorado Evil Empire...lol Not a good place for a 59 year-old lady with no income to be! I do hope you run for Sheriff -- that is, if there are any more free and fair elections to be had in this country. Which based on all that I'm seeing (including your report here) looks pretty doubtful. Feels to me like we're coming down to the wire with it.
Thanks Redfox I get it.
dtmfs wow thanks first contact in all of New England
I Know  where it is see you at noon...im in a grey 4runner
"Don‚Äôt be disheartened, All, at the low participation on this site. People are nervous."

Participation is low not from nervousness, but because people thought this group would offer answers and action.  Instead it's nothing but hollow online complaining that you see elsewhere.
Counter-surveillance measures against the Beast. We're going to need them.
https://youtu.be/lf3mzi1xoIk
Welcome! Glad to have you.
The online whining recognizable on all social media platforms is a spot-on assessment. There are 18 million veterans alone, not counting civilians sworn to protect and serve. And Oath Keepers has roughly 35,000 members. Less than one out of two thousand veterans alone remember that oath about defending against enemies foreign and domestic, and less than that seeing the enemy our nation faces today, far less willing to do anything about it.....Land of the Home, Free of the Brave!
Hannity, Carlson, Gorka, Bongino, the list goes on. We all know what's wrong. There isn't a war for America's Soul. Fighting a war suggests we the people are actually in it. That couldn't be further from the truth. Knowing you are in the right, duty bound to defend our freedoms guaranteed by the same Constitution that demands we do that, means nothing. If, in fact, we stand idly by, and do nothing. The Framers of the Constitution knew they were being wronged by the English, and put an end to such tyranny. Never saw a single thing fixed by simply knowing there was a problem. Government is law. Corruption is then criminal. Criminals will not convict themselves. Whose government....? Ours! See anybody else....? That is the Detroit Breakdown. Standing by for the Motor City Shakedown!
Well, at least they're wearing masks and Biden-Harris t-shirts, right? But looks like they still need a bit of work on their Socialist distancing. They actually don't appear to be hurting that much. No doubt some nice Soros/CCP starter cash lining their pockets. I'm sure they'll all be good little communist party minions. As far as their "pursuing the American Dream," apparently, someone  didn't give them the memo...lol Just another beautiful day in the Digital Gulag :slight_smile:
JB here in South East Los Angeles!
Maybe for some, but not for all.
Sounds good! See you at noon

Good morning all 
Good morning big Dave and the rest of you Patriots.
Looks promising if they can do it or just do it 
Good morning ssgtgman! How‚Äôs MA this morning?
I was catching up on the chat from last night. Yes this place has been a place to air complaints or gripes as needed. Why? Because in some cases some of us cannot speak it‚Äôs those around us for a variety of reasons without being thought of as crazy or scared or what have you. Whatever if they don‚Äôt want to listen you cannot do that for them. I have gotten a lot from this site for the first time in 8 years of being with OK. I learned more about radios to be able to improve my own comms here at home, I have been able to chat with and locate other OKers nearby that are willing to meet and link up to start organizing. That‚Äôs more then I ever had before. And yes I think some are laying low in light of recent events, looking for leaders to follow as well. But we all have different family circumstances to consider so we will all have to decide what to do that is best for each individual circumstance and try and maintain support for this cause which is just and true. I encourage all of us to keep trying to find other OKers in your area or close enough and make those face to face connections. The 2 I will be meeting up with, 1 is a few hours away. I will be in his neck of the woods for work so we worked out a link up. Let‚Äôs all do what we have to do and remember get those gripes out we are hear to listen and support each other. IF WE lose Faith, we will all LOSE. Soapbox surrendered to the next person
Good morning NC! Reach out to help brain storm and get organized! 
Roger that big Dave. My son in law's step father is a retired Army LT Col and was in DC on Jan6th. We will be face to face this weekend celebrating Easter and I will be talking OKrs with him. He is only 2 hrs North so we'll see. I do appreciate the "keep the faith" mentality that you all are exhibiting. My fear is that circumstances have and are changing for the worse sooo rapidly that I don't believe we have the luxury of a slow roll any longer!
Good morning Patriots!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Once again, military ‚Äúleadership‚Äù....
Good morning jpj, Yesterday you mentioned the SR wants deep vetting. I thought I would share with you that the application to the Proud Boys requires that you give "a lot" of personal info. Might be something for us to consider, at least on a voluntary basis and that would be required to achieve certain levels of OPSEC clearance.
Ssgtgman, I agree we cannot slow leak this anymore. Things are speeding up and that‚Äôs why as soon as I had the opportunity to meet up with the 1 OKer 2 hours away I made sure to arrange it. Hopefully your discussions will be good and lead to further contacts. The time is now to act at the local level
I think the PBs may have thought I was too old for them and that may be true ;^)
From SERE school the best tool in your survival tool box is Will. If you do not have the will to survive and live then it doesn‚Äôt matter how many fancy gadgets or whatever you have. That is why I continue to stress that because once applied solutions to problems will come. 
Race always comes into play in these articles. Gotta keep that narrative going. None of them should be guilty of anything considering what happened all last summer. Period. That is the People‚Äôs House as the idiots up there keep calling it but yet they were trespassing....stupid
Text i got on Telegram from an ex employee of Transtyle Transport in Phx area wanting to rehire her sending me the msg they sent her... "Ok, I'm reading the text again, it says, looking for 20 drivers, full time  who can work in Texas or Phoenix. Work in Tx is $6000 for 30 day period, room provided, lots of overtime earning 25 per hour. Pays well, government work. Contact name is Fred 602-541-6131 or email is transtyle.com"
Alright, I'm back.  Medical problems, not covid crap.
So considering I still can't find my DD, is there anything you need for the background check?

I am back, picked a shitty year to quit drinking...
James where you located
How are things
Definitely needs to be told!
Am I concerned? Of course. The survival of the Republic is not assured. What gives me hope is that there are many, many more people in this country who believe in law, order and the Constitution than there are OK members. Push comes to shove, I believe various disparate groups will align in defending against oppression.
yeah, it's something I noticed since in the group.  A lot of talk and no action; leadership seems more interested in interviews and pounding their chest.
The only choices these days are superhetrodyne of SDR.  Glad it is not SDR
Looks like for about $1500 one could build a repeater with a pair.  The RX out of band is not really needed.  These are ham units they have changed the firmware in to keep them from TX other than preprogramed GMRS.
Are you an experienced Unix systems engineer who can program and understands networking?
I think you only need the two to build a repeater
This is basically the same radio setup as HAM
You also need a repeater controller with identification a duplexer an antenna and hardline (very expensive non-flexible coax)
Add it all up and $1500-$2000.
Would be able to swing if I were working.
I'm sure. You must have been doing well before this crap hit
I have not done well since 2001.  Lost my business with the WTC attack
Went from doing $225K/year to doing almost nothing for the last 20 years.
Savings all gone.
That's a long time struggling
Tried to go back in the service, but harder for officers and they said at 40 I was too old.
I have some heavy hard coax not too long but if it would help it's yours. I can get the specs tomorrow.
Tried the FBI they did not understand cyber crime.  Now they have cyber crime specialists, but will not take me because too old.
I have no need at the moment.
Hardline is the least of it.
What the commies fail to understand is that so many of us have little left to lose.
They have a video on that GMRS radio I sent you. It made it sound like they were built to work as repeaters by just connecting two together?
You can do that and it will repeat, but that does not keep the TX from killing the RX
And of course if you use the same antenna it will be PERM KILL
so you need a duplexer to filter each from the other.
I suspect the connect them together interface does not have an ID, but it may.
In general a controller gives the call sign as required, allows for control of certain functions and times out the machine if there is someone hanging up the input with an open TX
Some controllers allow timed on and off of the repeater
Can you make any money with a repeater or is it just for boosting mission comms?
you can also switch from PL to NO PL
The days of making money with repeaters are gone.
Most that need the coverage use cell phones.
and can not really charge $$ for use of GMRS repeater if I recall correctly
So the interest in a repeater is for your own or OK comms
If I were flush I would have one at my fallback position for personal SHTF and would build one up for OK as a portable for operations.
Got it
Would be good to have it for portable relief comms
Are you up state for fallback or out of state
In days of old (20 years ago) there were trunk mounted mobile repeaters.  Guy with it in his trunk would drive to the top of a hill and instant comms
You should check that video out and maybe look into the radio's abilities. They may have more going on than you realize in the way of ease of repeater setup
And the second or HAM version I sent you is so similar I wouldn't be surprised if it wouldn't also have that repeater ability. It is Quad HAM band
duplexer from a reputable place
Looks beefy
440 is that 70cm or GMRS I can't recall
Or is that just the model number, no reference to frequency
The guy mentions using a duplexer only if you can't supply adequate distance between the two antennas. Otherwise all you need are the two radios, a CAT-5 cable, a power supply and two antennas.
440 Mhz is the middle of the 70cm ham band.  Just below FRS/GMRS and just above FM land mobile
You are looking at 100 feet of vertical seperation on the same tower as good.
then the TX and RX do not have the same sightlines
Not a good setup
Need even more distance if horizontal
Looks like the duplexer then
Maybe $1200 depending on price of antennas
I have been at this a while.  Problem is the folks getting paid for tech these days know maybe 1/2 what I know, but there is a perception that a "kid" is going to be better than an experienced person.
Think again
And that is not even the size antenna I would really want.  Just an early search result from a good vendor.
Ouch! $$$
hardline is about $2.50/foot.  Need a 100 foot run that is $250
Then the connectors are $30 each.  You need minimum 2, if you do not fuck up and if you do not want to run hard line from the radios to the duplexer
I was not far off on my estimate.
What makes those antenna so special that someone with your knowledge couldn't build his own for a $100
No you were right on target
The mechanical portions of the build to keep the antenna good in all sorts of weather for years.
Electrically what is inside I could build easy enough, but it would take LOTS of time to get the dimensions right and lots of tuning with expensive equipment.
Time is money when your working but when your not saving is saving
Not if you have to buy EXPENSIVE UHF antenna analyzers and signal generators.
Fiberglass or even carbon fiber poles are all over online
test equipment would cost more than a good antenna
Oh you don't have that. Enough said.
O-scope and fancy SWR meters or?
Nope.  My test equipment tops out at 30 Mhz for most things and 150 Mhz for other things
Antenna analyzer, stable calibrated frequency generator, are a start
High frequency or at least in the 450mhz range I see
Probably a Time Domain Reflectometer good to 500Mzh
So much for my dreams of building my own antennas
What about all of the simple charts on building J-pole antennas
Not efficient enough
Simple antennas can be built without much equipment.
Jpole is 0db gain
for a repeater you want gain.  I would want at least 6 maybe 12 db
High gain antennas require $$ equipment
That explains their price
What was that the gain on that one for $800
I have built 90% of my antennas for the last 40 years, but high gain omni directional antenna take exotic equipment to get right or LOTS of time.
only 2.5db
and luck
So one in the 6 to 12db range would be what $1500 to $2500
Depends on the maker and other factors, but I have seen antenna that expensive
I have to hit the rack.  Have a Dr appointment in the AM
So as they say "you get what pay for"
I suppose.
@Nationalvp Its all good :slight_smile:
Even the Aussies see it. 
Good morning all fellow OKers! Stay safe out there!
you too!
Will do!
Ill see you at noon 2day bubba....
10-4 brother
Back at you big Dave. I hope you and the boys have a great day.
I hope they help with your foot, I'm assuming it's the foot issue you spoke of that has you going to the doctor's this morning.
Do you have plantar fasciitis?
Good morning FL Patriots!
Well as a minimum we get to lay eyes on each other and start the process of organizing. Start to build that relationship and trust of brothers in arms that collectively believe in a cause greater than themselves
I hope everyone that is in NC has found a group to be in. If you haven't, shout out here and someone should be able to point you in a direction.
I'll do that. I'm currently focused on helping ALL PATRIOTS, no matter their current group affiliation, to get connected on the expansive "My Patriot Network," so that info can be disseminated both directions, from Counties to State level, even to the National level and vice versa. If you have at least one of your members in the NCSDF join MPN per county, you will be able to get connected to people that have not yet heard your message. However, the more people join, the better the exposure. My suggestion is for all Patriots to join because each person has their own personal network of family and friends. I've posted how to join earlier, because its a little tricky due to its hierarchy structure, but if you cant find that I'll send that info directly to you.
morning! I have a question if you don't mind me asking @zhtod is there any way to check on how the backround investigation is going? been waiting a bit so I'm a little curious as to how it's going
I had not received back the results of background check.     Will push to have this completed and get back with you ASAP.
Thank you! i appreciate it a lot, I'm looking forward to getting it out of the way!
If it's alright to ask, what will go on once it's squared away?
Meck Co and the Western Carolina mountains linking up today
Do you have time for a 5 minute phone call?
yeah sure no problem
NV area code, haven't bothered to get my phone number changed in years
i have sent the picture via text message to the number you called me with
Hey I am done because of a company Snafu. Can you meet up now?
Thank you sir. Looking into it now. Where are you located? I live in Concord but work in Charlotte
Good morning brothers and sisters, hope everyone is enjoying this final day of March.
Sorry again my man stupid idiot in my company screwed up the delivery I was expecting today. I will be back this way either next week or the week afterwards and then another time after that. Again sorry hope you see this in time not to truck downtown. 
I hung out until 1030 but gotta be heading back to Charlotte
_Participation [in this chat] is low not from nervousness, but because people thought this group would offer answers and action. Instead it's nothing but hollow online complaining that you see elsewhere._  --- @1984isNow 

I think that's a fair and accurate assessment, 1984. The OKer mission, posture, and organization is by and large DEFENSIVE in nature. Many patriotic Americans, however, are prepared and anxious to begin OFFENSIVE ops, violent and/or non-violent. 

I love a meme I saw making the rounds. You probably saw it. A photo of Clint Eastwood, clipped from the film _Grand Torino_. He's sitting on his porch, angry, resigned it's time for the adults to step in. The caption: WAIT UNTIL THE PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE GET INVOLVED.
No worries brother..missed your message till now...we catch up next time
Almost in tenn..haywood county
Im there already
waste to use hardline for dipole
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=KwRsq3wXYtjFHzbpo) I patiently wait for that day
Again sorry. It may end up that I come back up tomorrow or Friday. My company HQ is trying to uncluster this cluster. SMH! I will let you know. Have some stuff for ya from my OK membership package. 
But I love this stuff.
Cool...let me know when youll be back and ill be there
I am literally setting on my porch...angry and resigned!..as i type this
Even here in the communist area of Boston there are conservatives that I bump into walking my dog who talk of how "they are beside themselves" over this government takeover and how they have no respect for the appointed one. But they are not willing to do anything about it. F-ing sad!
SR live now
From an operational POV folded dipole is at DC ground regular dipole is not.  This makes it good for service in places where you can not disconnect the antenna during lightening storms.  It also decreases the noise level because static charges drain away.
folded dipole is a 300 ohm impedence and regular dipole is 75 ohms
If you look at every Revolution (except ours in 1776), you see the masses rise up when they begin starving and dying in the streets and ONLY when their governments are so corrupt and broke that they cannot hold them back.  We are at neither point, so for now the masses remain relatively comfortable and wait for everything to "blow over".  Unlike 1776, we don't have an overt foreign power lording over us telling us to suck it and like it so the political powder keg doesn't exist.
I need to get a fucking job
The final test to our people's resolve will be when the government comes to collect all the guns.  I fear that the overwhelming majority will comply, leaving the holdouts to the door kickers to take care of.
I'm not being "negative" here, just a realist.
What I see a major lack of is community organizing and protest.  Everyone seems to be sitting around and waiting for a WIlliam Wallace moment that is likely never to come.
Governments do pay attention to protests and if we were able to stage a Hong Kong style campaign, I think things would change for the better.
Non-violent, but massive, long and loud.  That really is the answer at this stage.
So on the folded collinear dipole do you have to add a ballun to bring the 300 ohms down to 50?
Good news is the insurrection narrative looks to be falling apart. Takes some of the pressure off us. Full speed ahead.
Narratives come and go and are often recycled.  Don't get too comfortable and stay vigilant.
Z, I believe you're correct. Most will comply thinking their life will go on as it is now since they have complied. But if they think Lucifer is done enslaving them, they are wrong. Do not comply, we have the God given right to be armed and a constitution that guarantees us that right. If you just comply, you have ripped out your rights, the main right that is was written so it will protect all of the other rights. It's all down hill from there. Washington DC will become the new Beijing capitol.
Amen brother!  Keep to the truth and watchful for the signs!
And what'd the doc say about your foot?
I really logged on to post this since it has been in my thoughts lately:  https://www.christianpost.com/news/is-it-too-late-for-america-to-be-spared-gods-judgment.html
It's a downer, but I think it's important for Christians to ponder and be aware of as a possibility.

Usually when you buy a commercial antenna it comes with a balun.

We will be persecuted and some will become martyrs like Ashli Babbit but I think that's just the way these situations work. I personally have been struggling with the fear. I could go on about what I'm going to do in this situation or that but I truly don't know. But I pray for strength and knowledge and it calms me. As I have recently come back to God I found myself praying to God for council. It hit me like a brick. Jesus Christ is my savior! I don't need to know everything or how He resolves all things. Just that He is with me as long as I acknowledge Him and ask for His guidance. What a wonderful feeling.
Very nicely put andyjack, echoes my own fears and worries. As I wrote a few days ago my dad says trust in God that‚Äôs all we can do. 
Trust in God, but prepare to be his instrument of change.

What are your symptoms with your foot?
Building a colinear folded dipole array is not too hard, but without the right equipment getting the minute distances right for the right phasing is a pain.  Can be done, but a real pain.  There is a difference between the theory and real world.  Math gets you close, then have to tweek distances and have a way to measure multiple paramaters to get it right.
It hurts!

Andyjack, Fear not. The lord has your destiny in his hands. I for one, will do what is necessary to defend our country, my friends and the constitution. I was never in the service, but I will defend the US and all that is good to the end of days. You need not fear the unknown, if the unknown takes your life in vane, then you will be in the house of the lord from that point on and I can't think of a better place to be. Be strong and do what you must to ensure your family won't have to face the worst of times.

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/Comms_Radio_VHF_UHF?msg=xePhiKZG9fHMWngKM)  I like like Icom IC-2820H. 50w dualband, dual receiver, crossband repeat capability, detached face. Not too heavy.
My rule of thumb is for VHF/UHF HAM FM.  Good quality multiband hand held and a backup like the UV-5R or a lower end less feature full unit from one of the big ham makers.  Yaesu has an HT at about $80 these days that is quality.  Then for Mobile I add a mobile antenna and if I need more power an amp.  I have a 2 meter 40 watt amp I built in the 1980s that is still going, but primary amp for the car now is a dualband 2M 70cm unit that works well and produces 40 watts with only 2 watts in.
I use external mic and power with the HT and have it mounted on a stalk when I am in the car.  The amp lives out of site under a removable panel.
If I lived where I felt leaving a mobile radio in the car were not an invitation to broken windows and missing equipment I would go for a quad band FM unit at about 50 watts for 10/6/2/70cm.
Folks discount 52Mhz these days, but if you are not among skyscrapers it has better coverage for the same power than the higher frequencies.  Same for 10 meters if you have a General or higher license.
With 50 watts FM from actual sea level (on a boat) near JFK Airport I can work into a repeater about 70 miles away that I can not get into on the higher frequencies. Yes it has inputs on VHF/UHF as well.  Before the Sept 11 attack I regularly got into that repeater on my commute to work by car with a 25 watt radio.
Any news?  I have been occupied with other also important OK stuff.
‚Äú...mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable...‚ÄùThe conflicts will come when they come for the guns of the law-abiding citizens. The oligarchy has to disarm us to accomplish their objective: control. By then, we‚Äôll have been weakened financially‚Äî- lose our jobs, homes, bank accounts frozen, IRS audits, legal fees, etc. When enough desperation is created, this powder keg is going to blow. We need to 1) organize locally for common defense in a way that 2) allows us to pivot to offense when the time comes. Like I‚Äôve said before, as the heat gets turned up and the situation becomes unbearable, the gun owners will align with us. They need to know who we are, and how they can reach us. For that, we gotta get out there and engage the gun owners‚Äî- they are key in this fight.

_Well, it's desperately needed [a William Wallace moment] to restore the republic. I, for one, don't see restoration via political means a possibility any longer.  _ 
 -- @zephius  

The only peaceful, political solution at this point is an Article V convention of states, to add a few desperately needed amendments to our beloved Constitution. (A "convention of states" is NOT a constitutional convention. An Art. V convention of states ONLY adds additional amendments to our current Constitution, which currently has 27 amendments.)
No news. I started a new job this week. Working remote from home, and my brand new home modem was faulty. Nearly lost the job! Crazy week.
@jpj  I like your mobile set up!
There are TWO ways to amend our beloved Constitution: one, initiated by Congress and ratified by state legislatures; two, a convention of states. All of our current 27 amendments were accomplished by the former, initiated by Congress and ratified by 3/4 of the states. The option of using an Article V CONVENTION OF STATES to amend the US Constitution has never been exercised. 

Our Founders feared Congress may someday become so corrupt that an alternative means for adding amendments must be included in the US Constitution, hence the convention of states option. Smart, eh? The convention of states process completely BYPASSES CONGRESS. The states alone can initiate AND ratify additional amendments without the need for Congress, the President, or the Supreme Court's approval.  

Given the election process has been completely hijacked by the Left, a convention of states is the ONE and ONLY peaceful means of restoring the Republic.
...beyond a convention of states, it won't be peaceful.
Agreed, but with the spineless inaction of many on the right in our battleground states I can't see the numbers adding up.
@FN9  Do you have an update about AZ leadership?
Right or wrong, the WILLIAM WALLACE moment will NOT be coming from Oath Keepers.
Unless those battleground lawmakers awaken to the realization that they have made a horrible mistake and step up and correct it.
I think things are too far gone for a convention of states. It‚Äôs quite possible we‚Äôve just been through a political coup. Things will get worse; good people will be pushed and react.
A coup no doubt!
and, correct, Keeping.AZ‚Äî we won‚Äôt bring it‚Äî but when it‚Äôs brought to us, we‚Äôll give it.
indeed, ssgtman, indeed.
They on the left have been working on a coup from the day Trump was elected and they never let up.
I know redfox. Just trying to get others to speak up. 
Things are good. Even if I get a little more irritated each day with the bullshit the are pushing. 
So true....now it makes sense how killery thought she had the election in the bag, just like pedo joe..neither campaignesd and both couldnt get more than 7 people for a fake rally..even obongo couldnt get a crowd for pedo...They ALL KNEW THE ELECTIONS WERE Rigged..
So when you say states what is meant by that? Do you mean the reps? Or the people?
I believe it's the state lawmakers / Congress
Not Federal Congress
If the scope of your response to November's political coup extends beyond Oath Keepers's mission, PLEASE do NOT affiliate your actions with the OKers organization. 

Do as your conscience and faith dictate. We are each individuals, God's children. Yes, I am a proud, longtime Oath Keeper. But I am many things. I am a Christian, a man, a father, brother, son, and patriot. I am your countryman. 

When acting as an OKer, stay on mission. When acting outside OKers's mission, claim a different affiliation.  (Of course the media will assign to you whichever affiliation serves their purposes.)
Well shit, hard to believe that would happen then. The states are just as bad as the federal. 
nomad1776 that's why I said I doubt we'll have the numbers because of the spineless Republicans in those battleground states
Yea sir I got that. I was agreeing with you. 
They are spineless. but they are also as corrupt as the far lefties, and are bought by China, virtually identical to the left...
Oh wait that's German, I'm in the wrong conflict. lol
Lol. Seems fitting. 
And some, as myself, would call you a leader.
Lol :slight_smile:
Never learned Mandarin hope I never have to.
_So when you say states what is meant by that? Do you mean the reps? Or the people?_  -- @caileon 

Good question. Adding amendments to our beloved, Constitution via the Article V convention of states process, means ONLY the states are needed to initiate and ratify new amendments, COMPLETELY BYPASSING CONGRESS. By "states," the Founders meant each state's STATE LEGISLATURE or ASSEMBLY (state reps and state senators, NOT the state's US congressional Reps and Senators whom we send to Washington DC). A convention of states is a 3-STEP process.
Thanks for the explanation. I need to brush up on reading. It‚Äôs been awhile. 
My parents came from Cuba when Castro took over‚Äî- they‚Äôve seen this movie before. Difference is this isn‚Äôt Cuba. The right to keep and bear arms is in our DNA‚Äî and we‚Äôre not gonna hand them over.
@windy   I'm moved by your confidence.  Alas, I'm naturally inclined to a support role. God's will be done.
So, the individual state legislators and assmblymen are a voice for the people of the state . No federal intrusion.
caileon up @ 8:34 KAZ laid it out
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=vRZJjZTwKe6QXi2hR) Exactly. Not even the states' governor is involved in the process. Just the states' legislature.
Thank you for a good explanation. I am only on GAB, after getting permanently thrown off tw@tter and left fakebook when they froze the presidents(TRUMP) account...So, my real name is Barbara DeStasio, and if you are on GAB too, you'll understand why there are a lot of viewpoints, often good, but sometimes confusing, which end up in 10 round non-celebrity deathmatches. I am also a retired cop from Brooklyn, NYC, and fled to Florida last April. Nice to be here!
@caileon   Welcome!
Thank you so much!!
Hey Barbara welcome to the OK chat
Thank you, nice to meet you!
Barbara I believe we friended on the main OK page a while back before the chat was back up
Yes, we did...Nice to see you again!!
caileon I'm glad you got here.
How is FL treating you?
I go by the same on gab as here what is your name there?

The convention of states process completely BYPASSES CONGRESS.

A "convention of states" is NOT a constitutional convention. An Art. V convention of states ONLY adds additional amendments to our current Constitution, which currently has 27 amendments.

Like, what kind of amendments? Just off the top of my head . . . outlawing electronic voting machines, . . . term limits for congress, . . . abolish the Federal Reserve and establish an HONEST money system backed my gold and silver, and so on.

A convention of states is a 3-STEP process:
1)  State legislatures in 2/3rds of the states (34) pass a convention bill, initiating and authorizing the process.
2)  Each state selects their own delegates to send to the convention where delegates draft and vote on new amendments.
3)  State legislatures read and vote on the amendments passed by the convention.  If 3/4th of all state legislatures (38) pass by majority vote any of the convention's amendments, the amendments are added to the US Constitution.

Today, 32 of 50 state legislatures have Republican majorities.

I could not pull up my channel for Pennsylvania.  Are the channels not up now?
Hi Fire! I just checked for you. All the state channels are up. When you click the world icon in the top left of the screen, you will the first set of states in alphabetical order. There are three pages of states. Just go down to the bottom right there, and you'll see the number 1-3. Click "2" for the page with PA :slight_smile:
I have been holding onto hope of a CoS actually happening, however the neo-marxists have eviscerated our Constitution with the over abuse of EOs and unconstitutional house and senate bills to the point of rendering it into toilet tissue.  I think a more likely course of action is for red states to secede from the union and start CWII.  In fact, I think the neo-marxists in the deep state are pushing us there because they really believe they have our military under their control and would quickly suppress any "rebel" states. Of course the left ignores history and thus is doomed to repeat it and I highly doubt our military would entirely remain loyal to the corrupt feds in that situation, but would in fact split in loyalties.  This is why the neo-marxists have been using their reeducation tactics on our military for the last 30 years, starting with Bill Clinton to turn servicemen and women to their side, especially with the brass.  I think their current demonization tactics are just a way to turn the average American against groups such as the OKs since they deem anyone that identifies as a Patriot a threat, which to their demonic doctrine it is.  As a threat I mean ideological, not physical as the light of truth is the ultimate weapon against the darkness of lies.
If a CoS succeeded, the Left would simply label whatever amendment they disagreed with (which face it, would likely be ALL of them) racist, sexist, or whatever-ist they can think of and lawfare it our of existence and probably still push us into CWII.  Or, pehaps it would buy some time and cause the Left to bitch about it for awhile, back down, regroup, and create another coup down the line.  Who knows other than our heavenly father at this point.
I fully support any action that can bring us away from the brink and restore our Constitutional rights without harming anyone.  Civil Wars are the bloodiest and no one walks away clean.  Marxist takeovers, however, are even bloodier and result in the disintegration of all honor and dignity for generations.
Anyway, I'm not trying to be defeatist here, just thinking out loud while I try to find some semblance of sanity in this insane period we are living in.  I suspect all of you are doing the same.  Thank you all for letting me vent a bit.
I want to leave you all with this biblical passage as it spoke deeply to me today:  "Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit  who has been given to us" - Romans 5:3.
Good morning all! Lively conversation last night as always. My dad has been pushing the CoS as well under Article V. They are however in my opinion just as corrupt in some states and not sure some would even get off their collective fat butts and do anything anyway. Zephius is correct in his assessment I believe. No matter what we do we will always be called sexist, racist etc etc etc, simply because we cling to the ideas that made this country. One thing we know is that communism can not survive long term because eventually the oppressed gain enough to rise up especially if they have tasted that freedom. I too am looking for a light in this sea of darkness. By coming in here it helps to know I am not alone, so thanks to all

DaveyE7,  State law here allows the Gov. a 60 day health related mandate.  But then the Gov. must get an extension from the state legislature.  Gov. Ewers extended his mask mandate four times unilaterally claiming the nature of the COV-19 outbreak was changing.  The State Supreme court said No, it's the same outbreak so the Gov. should have come to the legislature the first time.  Milwaukee, Dane, and Rock counties (and some others) are keeping the mask orders in effect.

Without my rifle, I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will... My rifle and myself know that what counts in this war is not the rounds we fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit... My rifle is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. I will ever guard it against the ravages of weather and damage as I will ever guard my legs, my arms, my eyes and my heart against damage. I will keep my rifle clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will... Before God, I swear this creed. My rifle and myself are the defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life. So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy, but peace! by Major General William H. Rupertus (USMC, Retired)
Been a member of OK for a while and reviewed the video on our website as Redfox did. Reminded me of why I joined and why I am wanting to work harder then ever to preserve, protect and defend what we have made here for my children and grandchildren. So help me God!
It's a small world. My brother just moved down here and is staying with me until his house is built. He is a retired Maryland State Trooper and is also retired city police chief. You will be surprised on how many retired Maryland troopers, county sheriff's, ect. are living in this area. Seems like a lot of retired police officials live right here in our community.
Yes it starts. The last thing in play is location. The county is reluctant to allow the audit to take place where the ballots/equipment is stored while the Senate prefers it be conducted there so as to maintain the chain of custody. I follow several sources on this topic but can't find where I saw this mentioned yesterday afternoon.
UGH.....Sorry to hear about the problems.  Wish I could land a job!
Good news on Good Friday more and more states are taking up bills to nullify over reaching Federal Laws and Executive Orders!
Glad to see you made it into the chat chief!
Forgot this weekend was Easter Weekend.  Let's  get together Next Saturday or one evening this coming week.
It does the trick and no one is going to steal it from the car.  For VHF/UHF antenna in the city I run a 19 inch whip roof mounted.  For trips outside the city I run a 5.2db gain colinear, which makes the 4 watt radio about the same as a 15 watt radio into a 1/4 wave whip.
The 19 inch whip of course means no 6 meters, but there is not much 6 meter activity in NYC.  The big antenna covers 6/2/70cm.
Im on way..got held up....
Maricopa County BoS continue to be a bunch of penis heads, probably because there is an ongoing effort to have the lot of them recalled.
In my van
10 min out
That‚Äôs great to hear!
Excellent! Recall them at once!
I think you turned one entrance too soon off Livingston 
Hell yeah! Go states! 
jpj - the states are taking back their sovereignty, slowly but surely, this WILL restore the Republic as it was originally intended - this is how you do it w/o kinetics - fortunately the base structure has always been there & the only 'hold back' was the states taking action - looks like they 'got the msg' - it will gain traction with every legislative action they take against DC
Thanks! No problem. Just let me know!
I am almost ready to do my first AR build. I just need a muzzle break and a 3lb trigger 
Thanks for making the trip to meet up brother. Enjoyed the talk it was very encouraging! 
Keep the ball rolling! This needed to happen!
If enough states step up to the plate and pass laws like this, then it would be a major blow to the feds enforcing them. No man will take from me, for what God has given me, not government. An armed society is a polite society.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=5w4adE92qNMGSxstS) Too bad they didn't have the stones to nullify their state's electoral vote.
I was thinking that too KAZ
KAZ, DE7 - i'm beginning to think it was planned that way in order to truly 'drain it ALL DRY'!! - nationwide (actually globally) we have seen a slow 'infiltration' of bad guys from fed/state/county/local-cities for a long time now... right under our noses, starting with educating our children! we fell asleep BUT now we're wide awake & the 'slowMos' are starting to come around too (we need the slowMos to see) - we ALL need to see 'who's who' from the local dogcatcher up to POTUS! you CANNOT leave ONE bad guy standing or their agenda will still be active - me thinks the 'BIG reveal' is about to go HOT!
Nothing dampens your spirits, @denbo
Love it denbo! Dog catcher on up! Love it!
KAZ... 'glass half-full' brother! (filled with the Holy Spirit) ... was not always that way!
Great example of an idiot....the Chicago mayor 
DE7... Beetlejuice's twin-sister... lets face it... the dead don't think clearly! lol
Lol love that one!
So I guess I'm off the hook because I didn't buy any guns or ammo with that fiat money?
I never wanted to build an AR, felt no need for one...last year (with the Covid-Bonus check), completed one and the second last summer...first 5.56/.223, second in 7.62x39.  Looking to do a pistol with this Covid-Bonus check, can't decide if 5.56 or 7.62x39 (300 blackout is too hard to find at reasonable prices).  I was going to build the second in 6.5 Grendel, but it now is almost impossible to find the ammo, so import AK ammo it is!
So many people falling for the oligarch‚Äôs plan of stoking racial fires, which begets violence, which begets more govt intervention and control. In the end we all end up against the wall, and the political elite solidify their position.
Meant ‚Äúoligarchy‚Äôs plan...‚Äù
Any Ohio OKs out there? Join us in the Ohio chat!
We‚Äôve got to get together. The struggle is not racial‚Äî- it‚Äôs about our freedoms and resisting tyranny.

You have to keep your ranks clean.
we'd meet up for events, I got them all on signal
Yeah I know
I sent Rhodes some lengthy texts on that
we have to vet at the lowest levels
I've been in various groups over the years here & CA

I don't care about gender at all
I knew alot of great female soldiers and marines, even married one

this is were people have to cowboy up and do the right thing
quit sucking down McWorld and Starbucks and educate
its gonna take faith and steel from here on out
Build your relationship with God,family, and yourself
start asking the hard questions of yourself and those around you\
great men and women have done this over and over
Washington,Adams,Jefferson, my ancestor Dr Hall of Georgia
they all asked these questions
Nothing new under the sun as King Solomon said
America has been turned into a collective of serfs and skilled labor to fuel gobalism
and we carry the world
the world is still in the old medieval patterns, we just have enough distractions now to make you think your free
freedom probably ended in this country around 1860
once the so called ''civil war'' was over
banks took over, the families of Europe and old alliances, western manifest destiny
Has anyone ever seen or heard from a National or regional leader?  Are there any?
sure, I've talked to afew
things are being restructed
sorry, can't type well, I'm not a book Marine, I'm a killer. lol
look to your state room, send some messages, you will be contacted
most are good about getting back
good over there?
Rhodes sent me a 406 number to contact him, that still good?
got in contact with FN9, thanks for your help!
still on phone  sorry
no worries, I'm patient lol
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=v47mJiFGxvs4W4xvR) been a slow, slow walk brother... time is NOT a luxury anymore - [condition: YOYO] ain't gonna cut it for most if/when things go kinetic - the bad guys want us separated/divided, they do NOT want us 'coming together' as a force - we cannot afford to wait for long
sorry, if you see this later.  Just got off phone, a good friend of mine that had run for CA Governor called me to catch up.  It was nice chatting with you.
I'm still here
i was on the phone with one of my people in Tucson
all good
is that number good for Rhodes?
406 area code?
I think we're going to see a lot more police move to Florida, as the Northeastern states are becoming more liberal, and hostile to the police. I'm so happy my nephew, a NYC cop currently, just passed all the training and exams for a Florida PD. I think he wants to work in Tampa, but will accept almost any offer from a SW Fla. PD. It's a relief for me, and his mom (my sister), a retired NYC cop also. That means my sister will move here too! There are so many NYPD cops leaving, that the city council is trying to pass a law that reduces the number of cops  who can resign. That won't work, so I guess we will make room for them!! Maybe we will get more OK members.....It's a very small world!
thats what he passed to me, I figure he must be rotating burners
I would
In my professional opinion it will go kenetic
it will start small
we are reliving whats already been played out for centuries
fortunately we have about maybe 150,000 Veterans comfortable with this kind of conflict
I cant  give you his # without his permission.  What is your last name and I'll ask him for the ok
all respect to everyone who deployed, but theres only a few of us that got our hands dirty
he gave me his number
thats why I dropped the area code
to see if it was still good
you have signal?
he has several #s You know how it works.  If he gives it to you then that's fine.  You can try it to see if it works
thats safe, mostly Israel has been hacking it
okay, yeah I sent plenty to the number he gave me
we definitely need to practice OPSEC
what have you been doing on the border
recon? observation?
I have signal.  that # is not good
my number is good
is the 623 # yours?
mine is 7146545570
i have no problem sending dd214s and proof
k ill text ya
no fraud here
ok  on signal
I rallied the clowns here for a time
wouldnt sweat Russia until Biden gives Iran nukes
Israel will attack then, probably have to nuke Syria
to deal with the terrorist groups propped up by Iran
then we'll have real problems
the kids will have matches folks

Good morning my fellow Patriots
I im a "thats my glass and i wanna know whos drinkin my milk!!!!!!!?"  Kinda guy
Last year, it took me 350 resumes to find a job!
...believe me, I kept track.
What's the brand/model of your colinear?
SEMPER FIDELIS......an eternal and collective commitment to the success of our battles, the progress of our Nation, and the steadfast loyalty to the fellow Marines we fight alongside......OORAH!!!!
Good morning to all my devildogs...and also to the rest  of you..i still love you.....but, not everybody can be lean green killin machines
Good morning all!
True statement, show me what to do and I can help. Mortars and rockets came in al the time when I was there and we could not shoot back because it wasn‚Äôt our job too. Damn frustrating but the way it was
Good morning NC
Good morning Patriots!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Good question. Nothing here in Colorado yet.
Good morning Texas!!!!
Anyone from north alabama or central southern Tennessee online?
Apathetic, that‚Äôs the word I was looking for yesterday to describe my fiancee with all of this stuff
Charge anybody who denies you service for refusing to wear the mask with. 
18 U.S.C.1951 - Interference with commerce by threats or violence.¬† ¬†Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years,
I have run into 9 people randomly while shopping yesterday who are ready to take this to the shooting level from wearing my infowars shirt.  These COVID shot and fake PCR tests passports are making many beyond fed up.  The backlash is coming.  I was fired from my job as an officer for the state of Nebraska last year for refusing to wear my mask at work and threatening supervisors or anybody in public who tries to make me wear one for shopping for food and other basic services.  I managed to force the stores I shop at to drop the mask scam on me after one to three visits to each one.
Now we're talking!
Sorry to hear about your job, but glad you stood your ground. I have not had any really bad encounters with not wearing a mask when out and about. Maybe dirty looks but who cares.
My dad has been pushing me to look into this for a while. He is one of us just as active as he can be at his age. Send me items if interest all the time and I send him OK stuff!
I have a hole article on this somewhere in my gab account. I'll look for it.
And where are you in NE? My last military assignment before retirement was Offutt in Omaha
Hey kt been busy traveling all over. Linked up with WKNC if you didn‚Äôt see in the NC chat. Good meeting, great talk and inspired me for more action. We need to meet up as well let me know your work schedule since you are down this way and we can work out a date and time to link up as well. Feel free to email me DaveyE7@protonmail.com
Not sure if this was posted yet. We need Gen Flynn as our leader
I saw a comment to that effect on here and I agree with that. Unite all the different groups like OK together to take out country back and kick out the commies
Or on this dm 
Just got in and sent a message to my reps in Raleigh, NC, thanks ssgtgman!
The last thing that The United States needs is an Article V Convention of States.  There is no limit to what the Convention can do, including rewriting the entire Constitution.  The original Constitution establishing The Republic is one of the greatest documents ever created and is the manifestation of God Himself.  The solution to all of our problems is not an Article V; but, rather to ENFORCE The Constitution as The Supreme Law of the Land.

Our Founders intentionally wrote The Constitution in plain and simple language so that the average person could understand.  To ensure that even people with less than average knowledge/intelligence could understand they frequently published Federalist Papers.

There also has to be severe limits placed on The US Supreme Court.  Through the years there have been groups of pseudo-intellectuals who have thought it necessary to argue every nuance, when interpretation in plain and simple language is all that was required.

Absolutely NO Article V. :cowboy:
:star2: "Honor the Texas flag; I pledge allegiance to thee, Texas, one state under God, one and indivisible." :cowboy:
I have done the same here in Nc...even had the police called by a store manager over the mask mandate...we are a constitutional county....police did nothing
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=tXQNaFKwek9nMxi5G) WKNC - somebody has to get you to the battle!... that would be the greatest water taxi in history!... the United States Navy! LOL 'the green rides the grey to get to the red'
Damn, was hoping the store was back up so I could grab some pmags with the Oath Keeper logo on it 
Most assuredly!!!!!
As did I
The founders did write into the Constitution Article V as well and all of the other beautiful things in it. The problem is the evil of man. The Dimwits have found ways to take advantage of or down right ignore the most beautiful document created by admittedly imperfect men. COS is looking to limit terms right now which is LONG overdue. It is not the absolute solution but a tool to be used to try and stem the tide somewhat. We of course have to be ever vigilant against abuses because ultimately We The People hold the final say so even though these days it does not feel that way. The pushback is coming.
Like adding term limits and balanced budget. 
I concur‚Äî a CoS will never come to pass; and in the improbable case that it did, it would be subject to a fraudulent process and the fraudulent results would be catastrophic to the Republic. We are dealing w/ sinister people who will ENSURE their own outcomes.
Attention OH OKs‚Äî-please join us in the Ohio chat room.
Any OKs in Geauga County?
I frankly do not believe it would come to pass either. I was unaware for example that NC has passed it through 1 part of the legislature but not the other and the R‚Äôs hold both houses. I think it is an option but as with any of these peaceful means and use of the system means I am not optimistic or naive to think they would be totally legitimate. I think if this was tried first we still would hope not to come to the means which we all seem to think will come and that is CWII
I think using this for finally getting term limits and balanced budgets would be a start. Getting the swamp creatures OUT and not able to make a career out of stealing from the taxpayer is a good start and would help 
_The last thing that The United States needs is an Article V Convention of States. There is no limit to what the Convention can do, including rewriting the entire Constitution._  --- @lonestarhog 

There are 2 ways to ADD amendments to the US Constitution. 
1)  Amendments proposed by Congress and ratified by 3/4 states.
2)  Amendments proposed by 2/3 states and ratified by 3/4 states, (aka convention of states).

Via option ONE, 27 amendments have already been safely added to the US Constitution. 
Option TWO (convention of states), is simply another way of ADDING amendments to the Constitution.

Lonestarhog, you are confusing a CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION with a convention of states.

If you were correct, then why hasn't Congress and the states abused, nullified, and/or replaced the whole US Constitution via option ONE???

Both option ONE and TWO are very high hurdles.  They ONLY add amendments to the US Constitution.
They should also reduce Congress's pay, take control over their own raises away from them and adjust their retirement pensions way down to real world comparisons. Additionally they should have the same healthcare that they pawn off on us. And they should not get tax payer paid attorneys and cover ups for their assault, rape and pedophilia charges and it should all be out in the open instead of buried like it is now.
And as I stated earlier the founding fathers made this part of the Constitution as well. They feared the evil and imperfections of man. Keeping hope and faith alive is what we need. We are all men and women of action I believe that are on here. But as a father and grandfather I have little ones to think about and if we can make any corrections that may help through a peaceful, Constitutional process then I am for it. I don‚Äôt hold my breath for any of it as a realist as well and someone who spent 20 years getting screwed over by the politicians who throughout recorded history have messed shit up. 
Absolutely all correct. 
Be subject to the real world like the rest of us‚Äî that would be great...
Agree, brother‚Äî there‚Äôs always hope.
Amen to that. They have built themselves their own mini kingdom. Time to end it. By the people for the people, not above the people! 
Btw, I read the GA election law in its entirety this afternoon‚Äî-u think any of the indignants actually bothered to read it before condemning it?
The ignorance‚Äî- or feigned outrage‚Äî is pathetic.
As I with you brother!
It is and they need to live as we do as the founding fathers intended! Period!
A *convention of states*: the LAST peaceful chance to restore the Republic.

Which begs the question, what are the chances a convention of states actually comes to pass, succeeds, and saves the Republic?

NOT LIKELY.

Where does that leave us? That leaves us with the PULL IN CASE OF EMERGENCY lever---the Second Amendment.
EXACTLY, KAZ! That‚Äôs been my singular recurrent point all along. Here‚Äôs a letter to the editor that was just approved for publication in a local paper:
Dear Editor:
 
Regarding the recent senseless Boulder, Colorado tragedy: Some call it, ‚Äúgun violence‚Äù.  Please, let‚Äôs call it what it is: Murders perpetrated by a deranged individual.
 
Regarding the countless murders that occur everyday in cities throughout this country: Some call it, ‚Äúgun violence‚Äù. Please, let‚Äôs call it what it is: Murders perpetrated by criminals.
 
As expected, some career politicians (who are always protected by armed guards) jump into action with talk of banning weapons that look a certain way, to registration proposals, etc. The problem is you can‚Äôt legislate violence out of humanity. This is a people problem, not a gun problem. That needs be the focus, not the abrogation of the rights of law-abiding citizens.
 
Take heed, all: History is replete with examples of governments using dramatic events as pretexts to deprive good citizens of their rights ‚Äúfor the good of all‚Äù. We need guard our precious inalienable rights with courage and conviction. I shudder to think what will become of the Republic should the Second Amendment be enfeebled or fall. Whosoever keeps and bears arms is in charge. In this country, it‚Äôs supposed to be THE PEOPLE.
@Redfox   Good letter to the editor. Surprised it was published!
"It's for your own safety" is the Siren song of the Left.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=gKPiCspG9sifcrA5F) i've been asked by the convention of states/TX to be the District Captain for district 142/TX... i'm thinkin about it
@denbo   CONGRATS! A worthy cause indeed.
Thanks‚Äî- yep, I was surprised, too‚Äî- the national papers would never publish it of course. However, the local papers aren‚Äôt all drinking the kool-aid‚Äî indoctrination works on some, not all.
Ya, congrats, denbo!
KAZ - i'm the 'quiet type' ...prefer the shadows, not the spotlight so i'm a little hesitant - that & being a member of CSPOA.org Posse plus this outfit... not sure if it would help/hinder so i'm sort of 'slow-slidin' to a decision - true we all need to grab the boot straps & make our efforts count, i'm just the introvert in the room LOL
thx guys! your support helps with the thought process for sure!
Any opinions on when the following will come to pass?

+  This forum will be deplatted again, permanently
+  Oath Keepers, III%, and other patriot groups will be outlawed as "domestic terrorist" organizations.
+  Gun registration (for new gun purchases)
+  OK leadership will be arrested, detained without bail, and tried for conspiring to commit insurrection.
+  COVID-19 passport legislation is passed (or at least the govt will give favor to corporations that self-enforce the concept).
Agreed. Imagine a convention controlled by leftists? Anyway, an amended or new constitution would likely be just as ignored as the present one.
I was actually wondering how come we‚Äôve not been deplatformed yet. We‚Äôre on the radar, so there‚Äôs a reason, rest assured. Information is being gathered, boys and girls.
the worst thing in life we can do is lose our Faith... our hope! the Constitution was written for the states not a federal 'overlord' & its going to take the states getting off their 6's & doing the things necessary to re-institute it as it was originally intended - we need to monitor/make darn sure they are acting & continue to act in a 'righteous' manner
we HAVE to get actively involved & it starts at the local level (i think i just answered my Q on the DC offer!) LOL
You are right. We are going to have to stand up and stand out in our localities to be seen and heard‚Äî and be prepared to take significant abuse for it.
All points are good and on target. As far as any of the questions poised by @Keeping.AZ I think each of us has to make our minds what our line in the sand is and what your reaction will be for your own family situation. Local level organization is essential. My dad has been pushing on the COS for a while since the election and he always is saying getting term limits will help get some of these yahoos out of office if, IF the states pull together. Again if this is a non kinetic option I am all for it, otherwise I have resigned myself to be prepared and have my family as prepped as I can. They are the reason to do all of this for me.
Totally agree, DaveyE7.
@denbo I guess you did answer your own question. I do not worry about being a member here. I know what we stand for is right and can show them. If people don‚Äôt want to understand fine, but they cannot stop you from utilizing your 1st Amendment right. Not after all that happened last summer and nothing has been shown to have happened in 6 Jan. As if we all need to be reminded nothing happened in the first place. I have an OK sticker on my work van and my truck. Don‚Äôt care who dislikes it and misunderstands it. 
Good night all got little ones to put to bed. Stay safe and vigilant always!
DE7 - i farted around for several years just getting the OK emails, CTA's, etc but never got the urge to get in the game so to speak, just 'observe' from the shadows LOL - BUT several months back the switch flipped & i knew i wasn't going stay sittin for long. my only regret is i went with the Liberty tree membership on monthly payment when i should have just done the dang annual payment! OK comms R fried so i can't fix it... LOL
WOW! shots fired outside - bout 6 houses west of me
Damn arm up denbo! Cover, concealment! Be careful out there
well that brought out the neighbors w/ guns LOL! nothing further, all went quiet... we see activity to the west - the consensus was '.40CAL GLOCK' 7-8 rapid shots - hope they were aimin at the ground & not each other
Lol good! Safety in numbers....
no worries DE7 - livin out of an ammo box now! even my day2day wardrobe is 'tactical' LOL
i sleep armed LOL
Me too my left hand will fall right on my pistol on the night stand, practice leads to perfection.

I have been a member since 2013. Watched all that would go on in these chats and answered up when asked by the then NC state coordinator we had. Let my membership lapse a few years but something told me to get back in and I did last April. Now after the election bs and 6 Jan I am all in and will do what has to be done. I have had thoughts of running against my congresswoman cause she‚Äôs an idiot rubber stamp for Pelosi. Waiting to see how the districts get redrawn here in NC as we are gaining a seat
Good morning all and Happy Easter to all. Enjoy the day!
Good morning and Happy Easter to all of the mighty Patriots and their families.
Happy Easter to you and your family. Can I ask if you use a antenna design software or if there is one that you recommend? 
Good morning everyone, I hope you all have a fantastic day.

Happy Easter to you as well. I tend to use the ARRL and RSGB books on antennas as a lot of the antenna software get complicated fast as most is geared towards yagi's and other advanced antennas. I do use a few site that have some of the formulas already set up as that gives me a good ballpark start my work in. Most of what i am doing is adapting older designs or designs that were never taken to this point and adapting them to 3D printing abilities. That and also setting them up for STEM use. As that is my main goals. I also am working on designs for deployable integrated MESH/local wifi/2m/70cm tower units and working with folks in Raynet on that as I am still getting my head around MESH systems (software is NOT a strong suit of mine).
Good morning Patriots. He Has Risen! :cross: 

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice all.
Just won a bidding for a a working FT-290R with a pre amp in it that give is 10Ws of output instead of 2W. The pre amp board is out of production so will be copying it for my other FT-290R that is getting repaired and a new screen and Cap's.
Cap's = Capacitors, if you are not familiar with the shorthand, no insult meant.
That will give me 2 x 2m radios with USB/LSB/CW/FM/AM capable. That can be tuned down to about 100Hz tolerance IF you have the tools and time. Luckily I have a friend who has the tools and I have items he wants for the time.
Yes I was a elevator repair tech. So I have electrical and some degree of electronics background 
ARRL you know RSGB = Radio Society of Great Britian.
Software is not anything I am familiar with either 
Okay, did not know so don't assume. Nasty word that is.
Software is something I need to get familiar with as it allows security on MESH nets if done right. And considering the distance you can get at 5W on 5Ghz it is worth learning as you can create a dark web very easy.
You may know the answer to this Q. On collinear folded dipole antennas I have seen them all segments in a direct line and also seen where they alternate 180¬∞  
What is the latter for? How does it work?
I can send you examples
On a fold dipole, array? as Collinear is a different type of antenna.
Also folded collinear 
Let me pull up the examples, one moment
 Open images 4th row down 3rd left to right this one alternates 180¬∞
One sec
Fold Dipoles can get strange as they interact with other frequencies easily and are better spaced apart and also limited to one function (either TX or RX but not both). I don't understand the math on that completely but that is what every study manual I have worked with states is best option when using them as they have higher impedance and need to be matched to the line that is feeding them. They are also wide band but they have their own price tags. Discone are even wider band and can cover multiple with one antenna group but you will get in to negative DBi with most of them when transmitting and they are only really good for VHF/UHF as they get way to lossy on any of the HF or micro/wifi frequencies.
diploes at right angles are used for satellite work.
Did you find that one that alternates 180¬∞
That is a Dipole array. Someone is being lazy calling them colinear dipoles. To be accurate that is a folded dipole array and there is a reason for parallel and at 180¬∞ from each other but would have to look it up. Read one time and found it interesting but have never used it as the matching and keeping interference down is a nightmare.
My understanding is that in order for them to multiply their strength / dB they have to be inline 
As in 1st image top left
Makes sense as that is the same requirement with normal dipoles.
So I am perplexed on the alternating unit
Though getting the pairing correct is going to be a nightmare.
one set is set to RX and the other to TX.
Alot has to do with phasing
Which in some systems is very common.
I will look up the articl IF I can find it and get it to you. Got to get the kids their sweets after Easter dinner.
G8ATD's book touches on it but not in depth. I think in either the 22nd or 23rd edition of either the ARRL or the RSGB  annual there is an article on it or one of my RADCOM issues. it has bend a long time since I read up on folded dipoles.
Take care
They are a lot of work to get to work well.
Again happy Easter and God Bless.

Good morning folks! I know we all know many reasons why not to take the Covid shot but here‚Äôs 40 to spread around..

https://welovetrump.com/2021/04/04/40-reasons-not-to-get-the-vaccine/
:rolling_eyes: FYI.....From Independent Journalist Jim Stone.....

RED ALERT: THE MOST TERRIFYING COVID VAX BUST, AND THE MOST TERRIFYING BUST EVER DONE, PERIOD

ONE LINE EXPLANATION: The Covid vax programs your body to produce a spike protein, which just so happens to be the prion for mad cow disease.
It was a trap. The entire Covid ruse was a con job to get people to accept a shot that would cause their body to manufacture the prions. The Americans who got the shot will die from this or become non- functional in about a year. And they intend to blame Trump for it.

Watch this hour and a half long Alex vid NOW>http://www.bitchute.com/video/9Qb6OhTrc7Pc <. He cuts to the chase right in the beginning, this video is not some guy wasting an hour to say a sentence of relevant stuff.
A white hat got all the elite documents with regard to the entire COVID plot and handed them to Alex Jones. HERE IS THE COVID GAME PLAN:

We all know the "covid vax" re-programs your DNA to produce a spike protein that's supposed to fight "covid". Alex got the real dirt on this, and the spike protein your body is actually programmed to produce is the prion that causes Crutzfeld Jacobs disease - otherwise known as "Mad Cow disease". Once you get the shot, you're a goner, you might as well just sit down and eat 10 mad cows.
HERE IS THE KICKER: Lately in media reports, they are already starting to report mysterious and un-traceable pockets of mad cow disease popping up in people in geographically separated areas, with no way to draw a link to a contaminated food source. Alex did not say this, it is something I noticed but did not even think about posting because mad cow disease is an old topic. Soon it will be the ONLY topic.

AND WORSE:
Once Alex got this tip off, he was able to go through old journals that talked about this plan 10 years ago, and originally Covid-19 was being discussed as a prion disease that is the same as mad cow disease. Their original outbreak plan did not use the coronavirus, it used prions and THAT is why the shots were ready so soon, they have been working on them since at least 2010 - a prion shot that goes in, produces no symptoms for six months or so, and then BOOM, your brain is GONE.

Thank You Windy, ditto for you.
@lonestarhog Wow! I knew the whole scamdemic was a ginormous psyops (and I knew the purpose of the operation was to destroy America and depopulate the world), but a lot didn't add up until now. Now it makes sense! Alex nails it sometimes. I'd rather know the truth, than put my head in the sand, but its getting to the point, where I see the draw of not looking anymore. 

By the way, does anyone know what so many truthers are accusing Alex to be a Zionist shill. So many things that I don't understand. Beyond "rabbit holes." This is full-blown inter-dimensional warfare.
I guess he wasn't inclusive enough of conservatives and white people. Very sad :slight_frown:

Good Morning to you too
Blitzrx morning 
Wow DaveyE7 that article is a "bitch"! They are going to make examples of our OK brethren. Very sad indeed. 
That‚Äôs some bs for sure
Do they have video evidence? 
Just wondering what they are basing it all on 
They may have been wearing our patch? There were some on video that had them. To me the real crime is that this dog and pony show of using OKs to set an example is that at the same time they are probably letting the antifa and blm bozos off with a slap on the wrist. Equal justice as with freedom of speech is extremely selective on the left.
I was thinking that too about blm and antifa. I have seen pics up close from 6 Jan of 2 guys with OK ball hats on. Does not mean they are members. And the NE corner was where SR told all in the PSD that day to meet up to stay AWAY from the bs. Let‚Äôs see what National has to say
I just say its the left trying to vilify the groups that stand against their bullshit and messed up worldviews 
Agree blitzrx
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=ItfGONAigAMfUIoZR) Thanks for posting, @proxima77 

I read the report. Seems to be missing some context. Here, let me help the DOJ by adding some context to the their report:

_The breach of the US Capitol building by courageous, unarmed patriots on Jan. 6th, 2021, was an unplanned and surprisingly measured  response to the Marxist takeover of the nation's 2020 presidential election. The successful election coup of modern America, accomplished Nov. 3rd, 2020, by far Left actors in coordination with enemies foreign and domestic effectively ended our Republic that stood on the integrity of the electoral process for more than 250 years. _

My deepest thanks to ALL patriots who stood together on Jan. 6th to send our message to the enemy: "We know what you did."

To Joshua James and Roberto Minuta, I SALUTE YOU.
Good morning Patriots,
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
I do not recall.  I will check later
I have no idea how many jobs I have applied for
Can you send as email?
Are you available Saturday around 1400?
I can try
It'll be up to google to send it
V141, all good things take time. Being through does not happen overnight. I have been waiting as well. I'm good with waiting so he can be sure he knows who we are.

Gang, given how the Supreme Court folded under pressure after the elections, I strongly suspect the trial in Minneapolis will give the mob what it wants. That, however, will not satisfy them. Appeasement does not work‚Äî it emboldens tyrants. We‚Äôve got to be prepared to defend ourselves and our homes from the unrelenting attacks that are forthcoming.
I use a set of Wouxon KG-UVD1P. These early models are frequency agile, but I block the public safety transmit function in the programming software and keep them receive only for scanning.  They are a step up from the Baofeng's with less spurious emissions. They are back up radios to my EMS radios.  I also have the Mirage BD-35 colinear 144/440.  It has a 7 watt max input, with a 35 watt output.  But I keep it in my Ham Go Bag since I don't need it much in this area.  I use a couple Heil HTH-K headsets since the Wouxon uses the same Kenwood style plugs. They both have battery eliminator car cords. For antennas I use a 19" whip, and a 5/8 wave 2m whip.
If there are any National OKs on here, please get word out to local leadership to visit the OH chat room. Thanks.
And more than that, we need to unite and fight back now. Let's not wait for their terrorism to come to our doors. By that time, it will be too late.

Yes sir
It says it sent on my end.
For weeks, Capitol riot defendants being held in Washington have complained that they are locked in their cells with virtually no human contact for 23 hours a day. But a startling, graphic account offered publicly in court on Tuesday by one such inmate, Ronald Sandlin, went further: alleging that guards have subjected those charged in the Jan. 6 events to violence, threats and verbal harassment.

‚ÄúMyself and others involved in the Jan. 6 incident are scared for their lives, not from each other but from correctional officers,‚Äù Sandlin said during a bail hearing conducted by video before U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how this is remotely acceptable,‚Äù he added, saying he was being subjected to ‚Äúmental torture.‚Äù

In an unusual direct plea to the judge, Sandlin said another Capitol riot defendant, Ryan Samsel, ‚Äúwas severely beaten by correctional officers, [is now] blind in one eye, has a skull fracture and detached retina.‚Äù

Sandlin also described racial tension between minority guards and the largely white defendants, some of whom have been publicly accused of membership in or association with white supremacist groups.

Look at duplex connectors.
I've seen them in 3 elements and 4 elements which will work so both radios  can function simultaneously? 
Where you not talking about duplexers? Just the connectors
Morning DaveyE7 and the rest of you constitutionalist, country loving Patriots.

I've seen that the duplexers have adjustable segments now I understand what they are adjusting.

Don't be so sure that charges will be filed against the cop who murdered her. This could lead to felony murder charges against our fellow OKs if they are convicted of lesser crimes. Happens from time to time with home invasions.
We shall see. It will be interesting to hear tomorrow 
Duplexers are different than coax switch units. For mobile transceiver in vehicle on which you want to mount 2 different band antennas, look into the duplexers made for your two ham bands. Or, just get ONE 2-band mobile antenna. Anyway, the "coax switches" are more for base operations, so you can easily connect different radios to different antennas.
@ssgtgman   Although 10M does fall into HF bands, it sounds more like you're setting up mobile comms for VHF and UHF.
Are you an actual admin, or is this just a handle?
Not sure if you are an Admin, my friend is an Oath Keeper in Massachusetts and learned through me that OK had a chat server.  She does not know the e-mail address she used to join, nor the password.  Is there a way to recover this information?
Hi  I'm not an admin  jpj is.  Is your friend a current member?  At this stage only current members get access .  When the vetting process is in place, it will open a section for the public.
Invite emails went out, like you must have received to current members only.
Ok, and I believe she is, but hasn't been getting e-mails.  I was going to reach out to Stewart however even on Facebook, when I was on thee, he never answered even when he's on my friends list.

After the previous platforms were taken down, new admission policies were put in place.  That maybe why she didn't get invite email and unable to log in
Stewart has been very busy as you can imagine
I think all the OK accounts were disabled on facebook
My account wasn't shut down.  I quit

Signed up for it years ago, when I was looking for a group with teeth.  OK seemed like that type.  And yes I live in New Hampshire.

NH is a swing state, didn't used to be.  When my parents moved her which I was 13 it was Red.  And I have been to AZ..  I stayed there for a week.  The ugliest woman there was so gorgeous. If that makes sense.

Yeah, well they better be careful what they wish for.
You probably will be then.  These anti 2A EOs just might do it
Then again, I'm shocked (and disappointed) that people have let things get this far
We are the capital of full automatic weapons ownership in NH.  Per capita, there's nowhere that holds a candle to full auto in the whole nation.
where is their line n the sand?
I am told they are working making the state a 2A sanctuary.
NH's Constitution was ratified in the state before the US Constitution,  Much of what's in our Constitution was put in the US one.
good.  more states need to step up.  So far I think AZ is only state where it's signed into law.  Other states working on it but not law yet
Well I'll be moving if it comes down to turning it in, but I think we are safe for 2 years.
I think NH had Con Carry before we did
Yes we had it nearly 5 years ago, I think.  I don't recall.
We got it in 2010
I got my permit in case Trump got the Con Carry in the USA.  And would have if he won, I am pretty sure.
2017 it looks like it was signed in.
You can get an AZ non resident CCW that's good in 38 or 39 states
I think NH is one of those states.
It is
I have my permit to carry, I submitted it on election day.  Trump won our town with a 2-1 margin.
When it wasn't announced until the next day, I was glad I got the permit.
Never before did I bother with it.
Right now I am hording ammo.  Even at hire prices.
I don't need one in AZ but got it so I wouldn't have to wait for NICS checks.   NICS phone lines are always busy
10M new gun owners in 2020.  I think the numbers is more than half if not 200M gun owners in the country.
glad I got ahead of the ammo famine
Most of my friends did too.  2 of my friends have enough for a small army.  I used to just plink, and bought an extra box each time I went out shooting..  Sadly I am late to the party.
Down here I can't even find snake shot
Is that like bird shot?
sort of........lower velocity to kill snakes without blowing something up doing it
I'm in a rural area with lots of rattlesnakes
My buddy with all the ammo to fund a small army, got a 300 Blackout and that's one gun he didn't have a lot of ammo in his collection.  When the famine came, we could only buy a box each.  So my other buddy and I would buy a 20 rnd for him.
Now it's also dried up.
I try to keep guns with same calibers so I don't have to stock so many kinds
All my pistols are 9mm, shotguns 12 ga etc
I went to Las Vegas while I was out there to see my cousin.  We went to Red Rock Canyon and me trying to get artsy photos of my cousin I went up the sides of the road.  My cousin yells at me there might be rattlers up on the hill I was on.  I never saw one, but it freaked me out.
I found 3 in my house , all within a week & half timeframe
I have a plethora of different gun calibers.  Makes it possible to pick up ammo off some that's dropped along the way.
see them often in warm months.  They like my back porch too
Damn, yeah, that would be something I wouldn't like about AZ.
We have some rattlers here, not often do we even have a snake bite incident here.
Ok, it's after 11:30 here, I must depart.  Take care Brother!
I just live in a snakey area.  Didn't see any when I lived in Tucson or Phoenix but in southern AZ rural areas, they are plentiful.  I have the local snake guys on speed dial for ones I can't shoot
BTW  I'm a female but a warrior  Good Night!
Well I never would have figured, and the pleasure is mine to make your quittance.  Name's Ken.
Same to you, Ken.  I'm Kait.  Been in OK since almost the beginning
Ever been to Lexington?
no.  I don't get east very often
Ok, well every year on the 19th, of April, I go there..
I escaped CA in 2010
God Bless you.  That place is a dumpster fire.
yep.  I saw the writing on the wall and moved to AZ
and I lived in Huntington Beach...by the beach.
If you are planning on getting a dual, tri, or quad band VHF radio just get an antenna that covers all the bands the radio covers.  They are made.  I have a triband antenna for 6-2-70cm.
Nice.  My friend Tim Chambers - The Saluting Marine lived is Oceanside.  I visited him out there in 2011.  Beautiful area.  Weather was unnaturally good weather.
I've doing working border field operations since 2006 in CA & AZ
Does Saturday at about 1330 or so work for you?
You're Border Patrol?
no.  I was in Leadership in Border Patrol Aux.....sponsered by DHS
Search & Rescue
My team was made up of ret & active duty Marines
Well, hats off to you for your service.  Call Firefighter is all my service was.
out of Pendleton in Oceanside
Yeah huge Marine population there.  Tim Chambers is a Marine.  You might not know his name, but he's pretty famous in the Marines and Biker community.
I still work with some BP & military
Ever hear of Iron Mike?  He was oldest most decorated living marine in the Corp
Nice, thank you for what you do!
He used to hold a little get together 1st Monday of every month at the Pendleton Officers Club for Wounded Warriors.  About 20 of us
would always attend his "Cigar Social"
I've seen the videos of Tim.  He's great!
Tim?  Yeah he's a pretty amazing guy.  I photographed his wedding to Lorraine in DC.
Thank YOU.!  We all have a role to fill
Tim's been photographed by some pretty amazing photographers.  Tim had his pick whom to capture their day.  He left it up to Lorraine and she said how about Ken.  One of the honors of my life to capture their wedding.
That's such a great honor!  You deserved it
jpj is online noe if you want him to check on your friend's member status and login
Here's a video of the images I shot, sort of long to watch.  It's on Facebook, which the page still lives there, but I am only on messenger there.

https://www.facebook.com/315930901801871/videos/1341958605865757
I'll shoot him a message tomorrow.  I already left a message to him.
My internet is not letting me load anything.  I have usually good internet but today it's been really wonky. It's been cutting out on me all day and seems really slow.  I'll look tomorrow when hopefully it's better.
I'll let you get to bed.  I'm heading that way myself.  It was great chatting with you!
Ok, it's a long video, and that isn't helping I imaging.
it's cutting out on little stuff too
It cut out 2 times during our chat
Well it'll be there tomorrow. and on and on.  I should post it on Rumble.
you should!
Yeah, remind me if I forget.  I'm bad at remembering to do important things like promoting my business.
I will.  what little I could get to load looked really good
Thank you : )
It was my pleasure.  Hope to chat more later  Good Night
Goodnight and sweet dreams, and keep up the good fight and Semper Fi.  From an Honorary Marine. (Unofficially)

Good morning all OathKeepers, stay strong and safe today. Interested to hear the EO crap on guns today from those that want to keep us safe. Such bs!
Good morning early bird DaveyE7, and to all of my OK brothers and sisters. 
Got a blocked email receipt back this morning, any other way you want me to try and send it? 
Almost every day brother!
Good morning Patriots, 
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

Hog :cowboy:
Apologize for the delay..i sent it today...look forward to hearing back..
I am contemplating the Icom IC-7100. It covers 160m-70cm except 1.25m. It will require something like the Tarheel 300A as well as the Yaesu ATAS 120A to cover the wide band width. And unless the IC-7100 with its dual antenna inputs will do the separation internally of a duplexer, I'll need one of those also? I understand that good bonding is a must and ferrite¬†bead inductors and¬†ferrite¬†chokes are a must to suppress high frequency¬†noise especially for the HF bands. I will also need a dedicated 462/467mhz antenna for my 50w GMRS and may need a bandpass filter on that? I'm gobbling up information online but I'm not entirely sure on the setup and how much separation between antennas I should shoot for? I would like to run them up on the BackRack of my pickup inline from left to right? I also plan on building a motorized and remotely operated 90¬∞ tilting antenna platform across the BackRack so I can avoid height limitations. I look forward to input from you all.
Just tried to send it again, if it doesn't then ill figure something out
Hey Shooter-OK-NH, would you happen to be Stas's stepdad?

So when does this group actually get off our asses and do something?

@1984isNow when something happens
we defend.
If we do absolutely anything without a proper reason, it would be absolute chaos. not to mention they have not stepped on our feet yet, they are only threatening to.
The staff for little joe is not ignorant on guns, this is about control period. Repeat a lie often enough.....
maintain your cool, focus on yourself and family. lastly, prepare for the worst and hope for the best.
you should not want to do anything, only if we need to will we rise to defend our home.
lol thanks davey
Wow after watching those clips I feel so much safer knowing ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù was applied. Oops, sorry phaser set for sarcasm
so much safer! the safest!
our glorious leader sure knows what he's talking about!
As an old Master Sergeant told me, if sense where common, everyone would have it. That‚Äôs stuck with me since 1988
Oops another phaser set for sarcasm
jpj, I'm looking at the IC-7100 or the Yaesu FT-818. Both cover from 160m to 70c. From what I have found that would require two antennas, like a Tarheel 300A and a Yaesu ATAS 120A. And a 3rd antenna for the GMRS. Both HAM radios have dual antenna ports so they must be internally separating the HF from the VHF/UHF but what about interference with the GMRS antenna? Would I need a bandpass filter on that GMRS antenna?
we all need to remember that together anything is possible. we do not stand for evil, we stand to protect our way of life, our family, and the citizens of this great country who live around us. don't let them tell you it's over, that everything will end. that is the devil, and the devil's job is to lie to you. we are truth, we are good, and we are family.
SR said it best in the PTV segment posted above, when they actually come for every gun, or try, that‚Äôs the line in the sand. 
Spot on V141
just another day
we can't forget why we are here.
And another clown show in DC
if we act in evil we are no better then antifuck
Never forget just like our POW/MIA brothers, never
I think I will go clean my guns and yell at them for being dangerous
True that! 
I will leave it off with this, If any of you feel demotivated or worried about the coming days, talk to each other! be there for each other! in this war we call life, the folks around you who are right here are your family, we are here for the same reasons. it's normal to be scared, you are no less of a man to admit you are fearful, but just because you are fearful does not mean you are not a warrior. you are not alone. we are in this together, stay strong patriots.
Well said v141. Never give up hope and don‚Äôt let them rattle us. Hold the line for together we can
we can overcome anything if we don't give up
your fear is the limit, but together we overcome that.
@Viper-Strike you are joining us here? if you don't mind me asking which city are you out of?
On the ATAS 120A, if I added a load coil that I could switch in and out of the ATAS's feed line when operating below the 40m band do you think it's likely I could work the ATAS down to 160m?
I am on Port Charlotte, FL
I see, you spoke to john already and submitted your info for the backround investigation?
But it appears as if I am not able to be vetted, so I think I will be deleting the OK chat profile.
I have not heard back in a good while
I see you have been vetted, right?
yeah, I am. have you not asked him for an update?
No, If it was coming through, he would of told me.
people aren't perfect you know bud, sometimes we make mistake
everyone here is volunteer, not always do we have time to get things done brother
I have 7 other family members with the same name in my family. So i'm sure I am hard to track down LOL
I am clean, Trust me
It sure would save a bunch, the Tarheel 300A is $835. And I already have a number of coils from work and if need be I could wind one from scratch.
when i asked john he got me set up quickly, john more then likely has a lot of work on his plate
i'll message him up and see if i can't find anything out
I will give it a little more time. I know he is most likely busy
how long you've been waitin' for?
Biden is arguing to let police into your home warrant free and take whatever they want, whenever they want.
https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/caniglia-v-strom/
I do hate to bother people too.
brother, you're not bothering anyone being here
you being here talking to me proves that you want to be here
if you really want to be here, don't give up
Yeah, I know. Thanks for chatting.
no problem, i'm always here.
even though ya' stole my callsign! haha
good luck with that though, sniffy
I don't give up, I am just serious about having a large group to assist or have assistance from when the time comes
that was my motivation for being here too
but even just a short time being here has helped me realize thats its not just about that
being a member is actively helping your community
I think communications is one of the top elements any and all groups need
do keep in mind i'm one of (if not) the youngest members here
i have a lot of time to dedicate
I envision all groups be in touch with each other nationwide. Without that, we are just little colonies that are easy to eleminate.
i like your thinking, but the priority lies in the state
we protect *our* home
now yes, *america* is our home, but we live in florida, it is our obligation to defend our homeland
But knowing what is going on 300 miles down the road could be a big benefit (Intel)
there's no shortage of that one
don't worry about it.
thats the job of the man up top
when you come in, you should expect to be doing the hard stuff
Without good communications even amongst other groups, we have no idea on what's coming so we can be prepared.
:clown: To The Sniffer & Pretend President,

The U.S. Constitution - including The Bill of Rights - does not convey, give, grant, nor transfer any of our Natural Rights.  As expressed in The Declaration of Independence - a template for the future U.S. Constitution - "...We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are *endowed by their Creator* with certain unalienable Rights, *that among these* are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness..." (Note, Sniffer, that not all of our Rights are expressed - only the paramount ones - upon which others are based.)  Our Natural Rights existed throughout Man's History, before there was any form of government.

There was contentious arguments as to whether or not The Constitution acknowledged and protected our Rights.  In order to get some of the hold-out Colonies to Ratify The Constitution, The Bill of Rights was added.  It did not convey, give, grant, not transfer any Right.  It was written in plain-and-simple language to ensure that there could be no misunderstanding nor misinterpretation.  

Simply put for you and the rest of your Commie cohorts, Sniffer, with or without The Bill of Rights, the Right still exists.  Take away any insurance policy and the underlying asset still exists.  Remove The Second Amendment and THE RIGHT STILL EXISTS!:rage: 

You still following, Sniffer?

Hog:cowboy:
listen, as i said.
there is communication, don't worry about it.
Ok, got yeah
Thats good to know
you're in way over your head
take it easy
one step at a time, you gotta walk up the steps to get to the front door ya know
Not really, I'm just a planner, not a reactor.
logistics is always helpful
just know the right place and the right time to apply it
Maybe that what takes me so long to do a project. I take too long to plan out the job
how old are you?
if you don't mind me asking
its been on the books for many years Andy - it is actually an upgrade from the original part of 2A referring to Militias
hmm, alright.
I'm not old by any means
well i'll be frank i ain't ever see anyone that age use the term "lmao" before, lol
well i'm just barely able to be here
17 years in the basket
I was using that term when you were in first grade
alright alright you don't gotta flex on me
come on now
Life is short, gotta laugh
i do agree there but then again. i do believe there are indeed more serious matters to work on
i'll speak to john and find out
Serious matters like checking my stocks today. See if I got beat up or made some dough. Be right back  "BRB"
And, I was using the term when YOU were in first grade!  (I'm in my 70th year)
that one was a knee slapper
@rev-mike how ya doing brother?
About as far over as I can bend, lately!
My answer to that is *always* "better than I deserve!"  I love it when they then come back telling me that I am doing good and well.  THEN I lay on them about the blood of Jesus, my Lord, and how I really deserve to go to hell, but because of His blood, I am saved.  An innocuous sounding response that leads to proselytizing, and THEY started it!!
well thats an answer and a half!
but good to hear it.
You got me on that one R

Man if you where north of Dallas instead of Houston. I could meet up
Can do. You may not get an immediate reply as phones are illegal at work unless on break. 
Ok, here's what I know.  Mass Oath Keepers was the group she was a part of.  She attended meetings they had in an attempt to gain membership, from what I know she was a part of the previous set ups however it doesn't sound like she was officially set up.  I will send her your e-mail address and have her explain the situation she is in.
Not married, and my ex-wife had no children before I married her, so, nope,
So did you get to see it?
I'm not taking executive orders from a rapist.
I can't even access the webstore...
Thanks for getting back. I just found out that my sun in law's stepdad is one of us but we haven't spoken in that regard yet. He recently moved to NH from the West coast and he is a big gun guy so I thought it was worth a shot. Thanks again 
No problem.  Had the nickname from being a photographer and a gun guy.
Good deal. I'm in the Boston area and contacts hear are non existent so I have figuring that I would be traveling north to meet up with any OKrs and my son in law's stepdad probably hasn't made any contacts yet in NH either as he has only moved there a couple of months ago. Maybe we can connect down the line.
The chat features in here really are bottom of the barrel.  So that could be why, other sites that are a lot better working and feature rich.... Like adding a photo is a cool feature that is MIA...
NH is a lame duck area honestly.
Has to be better than Mass. But I think that it takes work to pull teams together. Nikon or Canon?
I know nothing specifically. In general the left has its researchers, its media, its hackers, its rioters and its politicians that do what they do pretty good (for lack of a better term) individually while following but not necessarily communicating or coordinating with any of the others.
For mobile, work with VHF/UHF ham. The long antennas needed for HF bands are impractical for mobile Ham.
Well anyway, I'm heading into the VA in the morning for lazer on one of the eyeballs. Have to hit the hay.
@ssgtgman   For mobile, work with VHF/UHF ham, GMRS, and CB. The long antennas needed for HF bands are impractical for mobile Ham.  Don't forget to budget for all the connectors, adapters, feed line, jumpers, tools, meters, solder kit, grounding gear, books, mounting gear, computer software, CW gear, etc, etc. etc. It adds up FAST.
I salute you, sir, for you efforts to get something going there in Texas. I am in Southern Colorado (around 900 miles away from Magnolia). I would definitely be there if I had a better vehicle, but too far my old Buick to chance. I wish we were seeing more of these kind of meetups happening everywhere, but still no evidence of it here. I've reached out to folks in my community several times to gauge the interest, but nothing. I don't know what its going to take for people to stir Americans to taking action,, but I think Texas stands the best chances of leading the fight to take our country back. I'll be interested to hear what comes of it.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=8ERrga4QN7eBhzGTg) Thanks for posting this interview, @jpj 
And a BIG thanks to Steven and Duncan at *Patriot Transition Voice* for having Stewart Rhodes and Kellye SoRelle on your show!

I agree with SR on nearly every point. I agree, looking to election 2024 to restore the Republic is a fool's errand. The election process has been completely compromised by the Left. I agree, any future Trump campaign for 2024, lost my vote when he FAILED to invoke the Insurrection Act, an unconscionable dereliction of duty. (Besides, I expect the Left will arrest or assassinate Trump before 2024.) Don't get me wrong. I voted for Trump. I campaigned for Trump. I supported Trump. At this juncture in history, I can't support a candidate who places their legacy ahead of their oath of office. Failing to invoke the Insurrection Act now puts at risk millions of American lives. Unthinkable!

Rhodes is right, the country may not make it to 2024. 
Kellye is right, this is no longer America. 

There was something else Kellye began to describe but pulled back. She said she was told by one source in the "intel" community that the economic RESET (planned collapse of the US economy) is scheduled for this summer. 

While I am pleased as can be that SR and I agree on the state of the Union, as well as the valuable lessons we can apply today that our Founders' forged in their time, the unchanging nature of man, and the ultimate power in organizing at the local level, we disagree on the rules of engagement. As we look to our Founders' experience for guidance, we would be foolish to ignore conditions on the ground today in our age regarding matters of scale (population and sociological dynamics), recent history, as well as the speed at which news and communication travels today. Surely our Founders would have taken these factors into consideration and played them to their advantage as they set about igniting "brush fires of freedom" in the hearts of men. 

_Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! _ Patrick Henry, 1775,
The United States today does not have a duly elected president. The US office of the executive branch is vacant.  We have no president. We only have two branches of government as of Jan. 20th, this year. 

Let that sink in.

:boom: *April 19, 1775* at about 5 a.m., 700 British troops, on a mission to capture Patriot leaders and seize a Patriot arsenal, march into Lexington to find 77 armed minutemen under Captain John Parker waiting for them on the town‚Äôs common green. British Major John Pitcairn ordered the outnumbered Patriots to disperse, and after a moment‚Äôs hesitation the Americans began to drift off the green. Suddenly, a shot was fired from an undetermined gun, and a cloud of musket smoke soon covered the green. When the brief Battle of Lexington ended, eight Americans lay dead or dying and 10 others were wounded. Only one British soldier was injured, but *the American Revolution had begun.*

Hog:cowboy:
My conclusion: Time for Declaration of Independence 2.0 (Mike Lindell, Trump, etc. aside). If we have even half the courage and moral integrity of our Founding Fathers, to fight, we will win. For we will have God on our side. I cannot begin to believe that millions of patriotic Americans (especially us veterans, active duty military and law enforcement people) are going to allow America to become a full-on totalitarian slave state. Fuck what the rest of the planet, U.N., Bill Gates,, Jeff Bezos, Google, Facebook and the World Economic Forum want!

Let me know when y‚Äôall get together I would like to come drink a beer with y‚Äôall..
I argue that we only have one branch since the Judicial seems comfortable punting cases.
We need leaders! We do not need hollow promises but true leadership to do what is right even when no one is looking. And more so when everyone is looking. Elections need to stop being about popularity contests and making careers. The Founding Fathers never wanted that, but it has become that as they seemed to anticipate. The leaders I respect the most from my 20 years in the military are the ones who probably made me mad with their decisions even though I knew in my heart and in hindsight it was the right call. Weakness leads to bad decisions leading to bad results. Always has and always will 
Its fine, we got it.   In  a few days we can set up a time for a talk on the phone and if we sound like something you can be part of we can get you plugged in!
This article outlines exactly how I feel about the lockdowns and the Swamp's plans for us:  https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/exclusive-former-pfizer-vp-your-government-is-lying-to-you-in-a-way-that-could-lead-to-your-death
Do you remember the name (handle) of the woman in the group prior to being de-platformed?
was always posting the goofy shit
If I recall correctly, no one in the general chat group was invited to take part in any tele-meetings PRIOR to the election... and it was only leading up to Jan 6 that there were two invites, that I recall... is this correct?
Screening questionnaire? That.
To explain, I was researching a "Christian Exoo, a supposedly faux Antifa type and known as "@AntiFashGordon on twitter which led me to a "Molly Conger", an Antifa type known as "@SocialistDogMom on twitter and renown for doxing patriots which led me to an Article on Rolling Stone on her where she described sitting in on a Zoom meeting just prior to the election where this Exoo character described sitting in on an OK "nightly planning call" and described in detail several details of that call.
So, unless my recollections are incorrect, this would mean that this guy is in the "vetted" group.
Something for you to investigate. Or, just tell me to bug off....
That‚Äôs laughable. It‚Äôll be very effective at weeding out ‚Äúextremists‚Äù like us.
Either way, I bring it to your attention for not knowing anyone else.
i'm beginning to suspect that SECDEF is 'Metro-Sexual' LOL...... OR, transgender! LMBO!
Very true. I read this article as well and the gall of the political and rich elite buttheads. One day this will all bite them in their collective asses
The SecDef/retired General is a disgrace. Period. He obviously did not listen as a young Lt to his Senior NCO‚Äôs or learn a damn thing from them. The only colors that matter in the military is purple, to signify a joint op of some type ie working together and red for the color of your brother and sister in arms‚Äô blood that you all share. He allowed himself to be corrupted to make rank and power. Disgraceful 
I do wonder if this will put a kink in SR‚Äôs plan to tour military bases that he has been speaking about in interviews
Hello all NC OKers. Time to link up in the old North state
Many, many, have lost their way and their nerve. But not all. Most guys and gals in uniform understand what is happening‚Äî- the illegitimate CINC knows that and is petrified‚Äî all he can do is order the SECDEF to ‚Äúask‚Äù the troops if they‚Äôre extremists and ‚Äúeducate‚Äù‚Äî neither will work.
The questionnaire will just add more paperwork to a recruiters package and something to hang the troops with if they lie and they figure it out. Same as the drug screening forms the security clearance paperwork etc. I hope you are correct because we will need someone, some kind of reinforcements. If the German Army had acted sooner then Hitler may not have done all that he did for so long.

Good morning fellow OathKeepers! 
Good morn to thee, Brother DE7!
NC is definitely high on the list. Are you coastal or mountain? I've been a short walk from the beach but hankering for mountains and forests 
I am what they call the Piedmont and in the middle basically. I am in Charlotte about 2 hours to the mountains and 4 to the beach
Morning sir! How‚Äôs the mountains this morning?
Read the intro in this article, seem like my kinda folks especially if the far left loons don‚Äôt like em!
Agree link up and start the organizing at the local level
Good morning to y'all as well o7
 Driven through to Florida
I am trying to convince the fianc√©e to move away from Charlotte and get out while we can. We are on the edge of the city limits going towards SC, but more and more is being built around us. 
Good morning SC OathKeepers!
We all work together in the OKC area 
Good morning Patriots,
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
My wife won't move because our oldest daughter, grandkids and son in law are just a mile away. And then there are her gym rat friends. 
I bought a motorhome almost 2 years ago and was going to pull a "Gilligan". But instead of a 5 hour tour I was planning a 5 year tour with just me and my dog. But I think my wife has a voodoo doll of me. When I get close to go time she stabs that that sucker!  Just as I was finishing up a few loose  ends around the house I tor my hip labrum. Then a high ankle sprain, and yesterday emergency lazer on my left eye for a retina tear. Falling apart at the seems üò≥
My fianc√©es kids‚Äô father is also close by. Last year I offered to have all of us under the same roof away from Charlotte and he said no as did her oldest daughter
Well damn man get down here and I will be the super glue and hook you up lol
Thanks for the chuckle. I get yelled at all the time for using super glue on cuts.
They actually use it in ER‚Äôs so I don‚Äôt know why! 
The family always says it's different stuff. What do they know 
Have you gotten into HAM or GMRS yet
Not really much different. An ER Dr where I worked security for the hospital gave me what they use for a cut and it‚Äôs pretty much the same
I got my GMRS license last month and bought 2 more Motorola GMRS radios and a Baofeng radio to listen üòâ
It's was created for emergencies in Nam from what I read
I used to inspect and maintain USAF survival radios when I was in. We never did internal repairs just function checks etc
Periodic inspections, testing things like that
I worked on the really old Vietnam era radios 
At first
I have a 50 watt GMRS mobile on the way. Have a small army's worth of Baofeng and FRS, a new (7 band RX dual band TX) HT, a Kenwood TS-2000 all band base HAM and a couple of CBs.  Have to knuckle down and get my HAM license. 
I have my old CB radio packed away that I need to get back out and hooked back up as well
I have 5 FRS/GMRS radios all rechargeable and the Baofeng
You know the family members aren't going to have their own so as the responsible ones we store up for emergencies and they think we're nuts 
I have cover for that here, it‚Äôs called Hurricane Season!
So if I say let‚Äôs stock up in food, water etc then it‚Äôs all in the name of hurricane prep
Doubt it.  White racism is the hotness right now.  Eventually leading up to reduced rights or internment camps.
I have a "Elizabeth Warren" my white Jeep Cherokee! lol I'm doing a Mercedes OM617 diesel swap in her. Fully mechanical injection to keep her running after a solar flair or EMP. Have to get that done.
Definitely on the food and water 
Thought I would move this to our private dm. No family usually will not be that prepared so that‚Äôs why I bought 2 more radios to total 5 for us to talk with each other and designated channels primary and alternate. I actually bought a set of the Motorola T800 that was on the Comms thread. Looked at them at Cabelas and found them cheaper online. Work great with the Unidens I bought a few years ago
I should have bought an older Motorhome. The diesel in my 2011 is all electronic 
Lol you named your Jeep Elizabeth Warren! Lol

Certainly not jibber jabber to put everyone else through 
Lol I know right 
And I forgot we weren‚Äôt either
It's really a fairly cut and dry engine swap. Kit parts all available and the only welding is to the oil pan to move the sump. And that can be bought with a core swap from a guy online.
Well that‚Äôs good so you can manage it alone or got someone to help out?
Linked up with WKNC down here last week met face to face. Very encouraging meetjng
I have the ability and my neighbor is good with the wrenches to. He just lost his job do to a stupid move so he needs the extra $ I will slip him for helping out
I'm thinking on how I can make it more armored without looking like a part of the A-Team. Maybe swapping out the glass for Lexan? And I've seen promising results from certain truck bed liner as outer panel armor.
What brand liner? I may look at getting a liner for my Gladiator 
Maybe internal plates in the doors?
Sorry was bathing my special needs stepson. He had dental surgery yesterday and is not feeling well. And he is non verbal so makes it worse

And if you ever hop in that motor home and head this way stop in 
What will this moron and his handlers think of next. 
Nothing more than trying to seal the lid on the steal and grasp on power. Nothing more
Thousands evacuate as Caribbean volcano erupts - but only people vaccinated for covid are allowed to evacuate
If I have to go back over my data on the bed liners. There was an episode of Mythbusters that I they used LineX on cement block walls that made them stand tall to HE where the uncoated walls crumbled. But LineX is only  applied by specialty shops. DIY like the U-POL Raptor liner is one that comes to mind.
Your stepson comes first. Keep up the good work. 
It‚Äôs tough with 2 special needs boys in the house and an almost teenager who doesn‚Äôt want to help
And that makes sense with LineX. Helps stiffen the cement blocks
But still give a little to absorb the energy
I did up-armoring of our crappy vehicles in Iraq 03-04. Working with scraps because we never got the 1/4" armor plating that we ordered before going over. I worked hand in hand with the EOD to make sure that what I produced withstood 5.56-7.62 rounds and makeshift 155mm mortar IEDs. 
And I got him bathed 
Like bathing an octopus lol
I was in Iraq 2004-05 so we were there during the Wild West days
And we flew missions up in Iraq the year before from Qatar
We went twice over there in 11 months
Yes we were. I was to go in the first hit but Turkey shut us down so it caused a bottleneck through Kuwait and kept us held up in Ft Drum in 4' of snow preparing for 120¬∞ plus weather.
How long were your tour's? 
Ours was just over 12 months. Every other branch of our own and our allies military kept deployments to 6 months 
Lol of course! We went in May ‚Äò03 to Sep ‚Äò03 as relief for the initial guys, then 11 months later it was our official turn. The good thing was that it was all the same guys very few had left so we jelled really well. We were flying out of Balad, LSA Anaconda
Aug 04 to Jan 05 the second time 
I went twice more from NE 07 for 2 months then 08-09 for 4 months, 5 total including desert storm
Yes where about 6 months depending on the airframe
I was on Tallil air base 
Ran the allied trades shop. 
Ah yes Tallil 
Never went remember the name. Our guys may have had to emergency land there if I remember right
Went out with the AF EOD with my mini crain to load and off load 5 Frog 7 missiles and got to place the C-4 and push the go button on one of them at the disposal area
Nice! Balad had controlled dets all the time and of course fire pits 
You probably used C-4 for toothpaste 
We where always down wind
No I enjoyed the creature comforts along with the fight pilots 
I had to oversee the burn barrel duties every now and then
But we were constantly getting mortared and rocketed
These pits where huge we drove by to see what the heck was going on but damn that was huge!
Everything was in there 
I thought you were talking about the shit burn pits
Burn barrels I should say
The illegitimates are in power‚Äî- everything you‚Äôve seen and will see is about consolidation of the same in perpetuity.
The pits you're talking about was all EOD munitions captured
No these where the huge blocks long burn pits that burned everything from shelves to computers to boxes to you name it
And we had an EOD pit too for dets 
I am on the VA burn pit registry 
Because of that
And the Desert Storm registry as well
I looked into that. But I was lucky to have read an article on loosing your 100% rating. If you open any other case after they get to review everything over again. So I'm leaving well enough alone
I have not and will not claim anything. 1 because nothing is wrong I am fine right now, 2 I don‚Äôt want to clog up the line. Plenty of people are doing that for bs reasons and I will not block those that need it more than I do 
I saw on newsmax a little while ago that NYC is giving Biden's illegals $15,000 dollar checks
I also have Tricare so they are paying anyway
Me illegal, me get check?
What a joke
And NYC is so in the hole financially as it is. They're probably getting a big piece of the 2...billion dollar EO
Tricare, you must have finished 20
Yeah any of the cities run by the dimwits are up to eyeballs in debt
I did
20 years, 19 days
Good deal. I was heading that way but came out of Iraq with 8 herniated discs amongst other things 
Ouch damn man
5 lumbar 3 cervical 
I tried to pull my papers back after my ex wife cheated on me during my last deployment and that was the beginning of obamas bs presidency and I was told no you have to get out period no exception. 
And then there is the voodoo doll
Voodoo doll?
Yes she must have one of me somewhere. Every time I get close to leaving in my RV I get hurt and stuck at home
Ahhhh yes lol
She won‚Äôt go with?
She‚Äôs not buying into any of this going on?
He needs to be removed
 I hear ya that sucks
Mine is mindful of things going on and concerned for the families safety but is apathetic when it comes to all the high level crap going on that we all discuss. Her stepbrother is a big conspiracy theory guy and he pulls some way out of left field stuff out of thin air. So that‚Äôs why she is not to kean on any of this
But if I said it‚Äôs for safety and security of all of us she would do it I think
Sounds like he is stuck on the "Q" ideology. That gets far out there
He mixes too much together and thinks he has hit upon a solution. And yes he has mentioned Q ideology as well as being a supporter of BLM we think. He was mentioning that too at the height of it last year and the way he did was for feeling guilty and needing to repent for it. What I have no idea. So because of his far out there stuff I go unheard lol
Don't you "love it" when the loudmouths are spouting BS! 
Going to try a walk outside with my boxer. Eyepatch and all after that damnd lazer eyeball repair yesterday. Talk at you later
Ok later on brother

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=FeiktdbNASsHPurNG) @lonestarhog   Hahhaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Not an ounce of critical thinking going on in this UNICEF piece of leftwing propaganda. "We should not call them side effects, that's too negative. We should call them intended effects!"  Hahhhaaaaaaaaaaa. :joy: 

You don't even have to go any further than looking at how the film makers sequenced their message to catch the leftwing slant: first to the child, then parents, PhD student, and finally to the field expert. The sequencing and script imply parents are as stupid as children.  However, 22-year old PhD students (ie students coming out of leftwing university incubators), are vastly more qualified and knowledgeable about matters of public health and child care than PARENTS. 

Saw that coming a mile away!
Exactly @Keeping.AZ. Such bs propaganda Gobbels would be proud of it
Did you all know the Air Guard lost 2 helicopters to the Branch Davidians? Lol what a joke this guy is. And he STILL calls them assault weapons even after working for the ATF, just to advance a narrative
Of course, just politics‚Äî- the truth doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äî- they‚Äôll say and do anything they are told to say for, ultimately, financial gain or career advancement.
Exactly and people will swallow this crap hook line and sinker 
This whole Covid crap pisses me off because I hate seeing people scared of their own shadow and this is no different with this yahoo spouting off about crap he knows didn‚Äôt happen to advance and agenda and his own personal gain. 
BS is like a comforting drug to the masses‚Äî- what they would like to believe sounds and feels better than reality.
I will say I try to stay positive for the sake of what is at stake and what may happen to our country if we fail. Had a good conversation with @ssgtgman today. Found out we where in Iraq at the same time and all that. Brother to brother. Thanks for that my man!
It was good to hash over old times. Really good talk. Thank you kindly. 
We need that because we have to get it out to others that understand. Any time brother

The GMRS will need no filtering with the setup you mention @ssgtgman.  Just give it it's own antenna, and as you said you will need an HF antenna and a multiband VHF antenna for the other rig.
I strongly suggest however that you get a 160-10 meter ham rig and a seperate VHF/UHF rig.  There may be times when you need to operate on HF and VHF/UHF at the same time.  I have been there.
Plenty of hams work HF mobile.  The ARRL hand book and the Radio Handbook by Bill Orr are good resources.
I was working on 5 Mhz today from the mobile.

Thank you jpj. I've been all over the place trying to decide on what combination to put in my truck. The Yaesu FT-891, (160m/6m) is on sale for $610. My big draw to the IC-7100, is that for $170 bucks more (on sale for $780) I get (160m/70cm) Split mode on any band and Duplex on any band, plus D-Star. The Icom ID-4100A, (2m/70cm) and Built-in GPS is $310. Tri-Band China radios that cover 2m/1.25m/70cm are harder to find but one can be had for $400. I could get one now and look for a better deal on a Tri-Band later? And I've got the 50 watt GMRS on the way.
Thanks for helping out. 73

@ssgtgman   For HF mobile ops, you could also consider keeping in your vehicle a long end-fed HF wire antenna. When you make a stop off road, you could string out that wire or throw that bad boy over tall tree branch for proper DX.

Note to all hams, comms guys, and those looking to come into amateur radio, keep an eye on the stock market and price of copper. When the SHTF, the price of copper wire may SKYROCKET.  You might consider re-figuring your budget priorities putting copper wire, feed line, jumpers, antenna, bonding, and grounding copper at the TOP of your shopping list for now.

With all this money printing and debt, the price of commodities like copper are going to EXPLODE higher soon. We don't know when or what will trigger the event, but the laws of economics are immutable. It's an eventuality.

We don't know when or what will trigger the event, but the laws of economics are immutable. It's an eventuality.

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=m68wCn5hedRToqxqj) Point taken. But tracing is a lot of work for ATF.  I'm sure Visa and MC are already forwarding gun purchase info to FBI. Nevertheless, it's much easier for the govt to simply implement universal gun registration to track, locate, and confiscate firearms.
Yee haw the buttheads are out in force today!
Agree, KAZ‚Äî and they‚Äôre going to try‚Äî it‚Äôs a matter of time‚Äî- and only an EO away.

Good morning all.
Morning sir you‚Äôre up early!
Good morning all OK brothers and sisters!
I read that yes. 
He is an idiot and a sell out. He knows it‚Äôs not true just pushing the agenda of the day is all. 
You to
Been thinking about it anyway now it‚Äôs closer to the front of my brain! Feels like it‚Äôs gonna melt
Almost always up this early
How are your two little Angel's
They are good the stepson went to his dad last night with his big sis. He‚Äôs doing better and my almost 4 year old is his usual self
All over the place
It is frustrating seeing what is being done in and to our Country for sure
Yes it is and with little ones makes it that much more fearful. Running my mind thinking about how we could get away from here and go to our safe place
Had you ever watched the documentary on Hitler's extreme ideas. There was one part where he had a ship built out of ice. It was mixed with sawdust and was very strong
I have seen documentaries like that on his crazy ideas but not that one no! Wow
Yes as materials became harder to obtain they built this ship with its own refrigeration. 
Makes sense part of his Wonder weapons that would turn the tide
I use a wood pellet stove. And if a bag gets wet the pellets turn into tater tots and then back to sawdust. 
Must activate a chemical reaction to congeal back together then dry out and disintegrate
I dumpt a bad bag out back and it froze over. I tried chipping it, man it was stuff and strong
Wow he must have been on to something or his slave scientists where  
Anyway to the point of this
This might sound crazy. But seeing for myself how strong it is. I thought if we were to make a slurry of sawdust and press and mold it with a bullet mold. You get the idea?
I do get it
I wonder what effect the explosion of the primer and powder would have on it
It would have to be worked on in a cold room and once pressed into the cartridge kept in a cooler with dry ice
It is so tough, I think it would withstand the pressure and breef heat
You think so? That‚Äôs a lot to endure. 
Plus the friction turning and going down the barrel
The beuty is two fold. Ammo shortage, and the biggie, it would leave no ballistics 
Lol true
In the body it would melt any riflings away if not turn back to sawdust by the time the attempted recovery ov the projectile 
Yes that‚Äôs true and therefore untraceable
Stored in dry ice how can you carry it?
Worth a bit of testing. If it will hold up it might make the perfect sniper round
I was thinking it would be best for sniper use
In the clips in a small cooler
Lunch box cooler would hold enough for a mission
The easiest test would be to load a shotgun shell. If that proves worthy on to .338 or .50
And so on and so on. I like the isea
Someone with reloading equipment shouldn't be too tough. Again a shotgun shell would be simple. A special mold may be needed for bullets. Like pouring hot lead and being able to split the mold
Yes agreed a shotgun slug would be a great first test. Know anyone who does reloading?
Not that I would feel comfortable sharing the idea. Too many commies here 
I keep forgetting you are behind enemy lines  
I was thinking to increase the grain weight which will probably be too light on its own. We may have to have a weighted core
Or maybe we could tri mixing in some powdered metal
That‚Äôs sound and would give it structure
And if kept cold something to stick too
To the slurry. But not sure how the latter would effect the composition 
Well try it. Get some shaved metal and let another bag freeze and see what happens
I can buy powdered metal at the welding supply 
But some ice cube trays and mix up some and freeze it 
There ya go! How‚Äôs all your ailments doing? Eyes etc?
Yes I think on the movie the Patriot he used a hand mold to make musket balls. Easy enough to do in the field and to carry
Alright gotta get ready and hit the road. I will be on and off here today. Good luck with your project today!
I was doing well yesterday afternoon. Took a good walk with my boy Reggie. Bumped into a cute blond neighbor who has a old boxer. She is a stonch conservative. Always good talking to. 
Glad to hear that and sound like there are others trapped behind the lines up in old Mass. Let me know how your test goes!

What size Tapcon did you use
Ok, I sent you an email from proton
Yes I have some I need to drive into the concrete blocks to secure my shed
I forget which size I bought
Got it --- and replied
I think they are a great idea for what you are trying to do 
I have not watched CRS but have heard of them. What do they say ?
Has anyone else thought of using the Tapcons before?
I like the concept of it and even though I have limited knowledge of ammo and such I get the concept. I don‚Äôt load my own I buy I shoot lol
That I did know. My buddy and I down here we‚Äôre going to start doing that together but we never did
That‚Äôs bs because that doesn‚Äôt make you a danger
My old lady has her LTC. 
I was thinking of getting a bow
No shit. It kills me when I think on it.
I have had mine since 2010. Carry every day even at home
That's how it should be
And even though I am not supposed to in my work vsn
When out for work I carry plus 2 mags to be able to get home in case SHTF
They changed the law about obeying the signs down here to a misdemeanor so I just ignore them now
I can open carry but don‚Äôt
Nope lol
Back up knife
The wife is too wimpy to carry even though she has it. What a waste 
That is a waste
I really need to find a replacement! 
Mine just took her class
To get hers
Good deal
Does she shoot with you 
She has the VA non resident permit which works in NC but not SC
When we have had time yes
So she's a vet to
No she isn‚Äôt
Her dad is a retired Ranger
Cool, fathered in pun intended 
He has an M1 carbine bedside
So cool
You all must have one hell of a fall back
I bought her a Kimber micro 9 2 years sgo

Good morning all NC OKers!
Good morning DaveyE7 and the rest of the troops. 
Trying to get Marines to turn in their fellow Marines, I am sure the other branches have similar bs out or up their sleeves. 
Fuk that shit.
Last night you said you were doing some driving this morning. Safe travels.
I have said it in here before, there will be no Operation Valkyrie coming from our military, not unless there is a purge of the left leaning leadership
That‚Äôs a normal day for me. Driving around NC and SC to service PT equipment for clinics 
We were talking yesterday while I was driving up I85 heading home from the Greenville, SC area
Oh cool. I wondered what you did for work. 
I am headed to Clemson University today to repair their super expensive treadmill. The company I work for is owned by a former Naval intelligence officer founded by his dad. Almost all of our technicians are prior/retired military. 
I just sent jpj a link to a device that connects VHF/UHF to any repeater in the world through the internet. Might be worth a look. https://youtu.be/bzoQaiJbyAo
Cool something else to listen to while driving lol
True. That's sounds like an interesting job. I was an elevator service and repair technician for 25 years. 
Nice! Used to deal with those guys when I was at the big hospital in Charlotte in security for entrapments 
I did security and law enforcement for while also
Ah good old entrapments. Lots of interesting memories there!
Lol yes
We had this poor med tech she got stuck like 3 shifts in a row, took the stairs every time after that
And what brought me down here besides my dad was JROTC 
I tried staying up to listen to SR last night but I pooped out. It started out with much the same over the Jan6th insident. 
Yeah I figured it probably would. Was this a pro Patriot show?
Well time to make the coffee 
Good. I know he doesn‚Äôt want to but I wish he would go on Tucker Carlson and get some good words out nationally. I think he would get more of a fair shake or any of the other more pro Patriot media 
I am already two cups in lol
I figured that
I agree. He isn't hitting the volume of listeners that he should be
He may have to bite that bullet and do it
Ok gotta get ready to hit the road
DaveyE7 thanks for the info. I can‚Äôt even imagine Marines turning on Marines but I would have never imagined America being socialist either but it is leaning that way

:face_with_monocle: Thought For The Day

Anyone who believes that to be a viable and effective Patriot requires extensive military experience and training - ya know, to be a "trigger puller" - then consider Chris Cheng.  Mr. Cheng was the Season Four Winner of the cancelled History Channel show Top Shot.  At the time, he was an IT Professional with no formal weapons training.  Chris was first taught how to fire a weapon at 6 years old by his father. He then began improving his skills, becoming familiar with pistols, rifles, and shotguns. (i.e. Self-Taught).  

To keep this short, Mr. Cheng demolished the other competitors who included former/present military, weapons instructors, SWAT, etc.  He was victorious with all types of weapons and displayed winning tactical skills.

There are literally thousands and thousands of Patriots like Mr. Cheng.  Patriots with what I consider winning attributes:  Attitude, Humility, Knowledge, Talent, and most importantly, Adaptability.

Ahh, ole school also.  Usmc 87-93,  then short stint in weekend warriors.  That didn't work for me if you know what I mean.  FYI, I changed my user name right after my last post to you asking your branch.
Got it. I hear you on the reserves. I went to the 187th infantry Army Reserve to be their motor sergeant. On my first weekend a spec4 in the motor pool handed me an old wooden index card box full of loose keyes and told me that I was going to have to go vehicle to vehicle to figure out what keys fit what. Then she added that a lot of keys were also missing because troops brought them home and lost them. I had just spent the previous day singing in to this obvious rag bag unit. I handed the box back to her and said if this is what the reserves are like I don't need it and headed to admin and signed out.

I've not used the id-5100A honestly. Picked up my 2820h used, and haven't looked back. Yes it has features I don't use, like the D-Star digital voice and GPS, but its never given .e any issues in the years I've owned it.
Sorry I've only just seen this and while it says it was sent yesterday not sure if that is accurate.
Yes yesterday. All good. The 2820H has great specs. But the Icom site says that the ID-5100A has replaced it. It has equally good numbers, maybe a bit larger display. Better for old blind fux like me. You've pointed me in a good direction there. Definitely better than the 4100.
Ok, yeah, I've looked at the 5100, now that I've looked I realize I have seen it before and yes, it does have a larger screen, which honestly, I preferred the smaller one on the 2820h for my purposes. Still not bad, and the addition to the Bluetooth smartphone connectivity is semi-appealing.
Im still here.
Just been busy as hell
Do you use your 2820 as a field or pack rig? If so how are you powering it? 
I think this will go nuclear fast, if it starts. Putin won't be stopping at Kiev. He will take it all the way to the English Channel. Only to be stopped by probable U.K. nuclear first-strike, The West hasn't the will to fight as they did through the Cold War.

I have been away from the computer largely.  Have a non-computer projecct I have to  finish.
Me too. Had 7.5 yds of concrete poured today!
We don't really have a poc as far as I know, 
Just having great skill with a weapon is not the same as having the discipline of knowing when to fire and when to hold it, how to follow orders despite your survival instinct telling you otherwise, and how to keep your cool when under fire of an enemy intent on killing you.  That is the difference between a marksman and a soldier.

I agree with you zephius. I think the point is that you do not have to have been a pro trigger puller to be able to shoot. Being a disciplined soldier requires more than that of course. And the fact he beat all of them in competition under simulated stress was impressive. 
The Spanish Civil War is a great example of what may come. I heard him say that in the interviews I have listened to lately and he is right. Required watching...

This is an interesting dichotomy. The VIRUS is suspect in my mind but President Trump went all in on it. The vaccines are suspect but the President went warp speed ahead. He is not a doctor or scientist so he has to rely on those who are. But pushing the vaccine to us conservatives seems like a non starter. What am I missing?
I have been blowing up my rep and Abbots phone and email to get this done. 
What my brother is tryin to say is this...a bullseye on a paper target..is different then looking a man in the eyes then turning his face into pink mist are like apples and oranges.......hot meat on rocks...ive seen it...ive smelt it....im the Marine that dealt it!!!
JESUS love Marines...we keep hell full of fresh souls!!!!
Ok she's been pestering me since I alerted them chat was working again.
Awful quiet over here. **smirks**
I understand that and yes it‚Äôs a different thing than a paper target, waaaaayyyy different. Difficult times call for difficult decisions. I have made my peace and will do what is necessary
They're talking about us patriots! Some halfway intelligent reporting about Biden's nomination of Chip Chipman to lead the communist assault on our God-given rights. Thought you might find it as insightful as I did, as an example of how even the most "fair" elements of MSM are spinning the current situation. You can tell both of them are heavily censoring themselves; struggling mighily to tamp down the fire, while knowing full well the situation is about to explode. Interesting to see independent voices on both sides hinting of truth, despite themselves.

I was gonna say one of these days someone is gonna pop off with that crap to the wrong person....I know that is what they want to happen so steady all, steady....

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=XtiZY1uvjo6JSyycL) I got a message from you. You live in Omaha
Yes Windy you are correct. He made good points and went so far then pulled back as did his co host. Either way this knuckle head Chipman is the WRONG choice. 
No I was stationed there until 2009 when I retired and moved down here to NC. I was wondering where you are in NE is all
Absolutely! I think all us Americans can agree on that. And because of that, the very few remaining honest journalists are starting to feel the heat. They know they will be faced with a choice soon.
And what the host said in that video about those with the real power is correct. You never fear who is on the throne, it‚Äôs the power behind it whoever is whispering in their ear is who is dangerous
That they will.....my line is drawn and I stand at the ready
I understand all the _drama_ that is at times part of this topic, especially from experienced Veterans.  However...and...that is a Texas-size HOWEVER...many people with no "experience" will perform and accomplish what is necessary to protect family, home, community.  

How many times has it been reported that "Eight year old kills intruder to save his Sister"..."Ten year old kills burglar and saves Mother and siblings"...and other such occurrences?

Years ago the military discovered that new recruits in combat situations had a zero to extremely insignificant kill.  It was discovered that - being inherent in Humans was the resistance to kill another - newbies would acquire, but shoot off-target at the last split second.  This was the genesis of what became video games.  The addition of life-like simulated training mentally conditioned the new soldiers who would then more rapidly perform in combat situations. (Ever wonder how these games and the rise of juvenile murders coincide somewhat?)

Shooting _stationary or moving paper targets that don't shoot back_ can be overcome with focused mental conditioning when acquiring and destroying said benign target.  Imagination can be a very strong force of influence.

Discipline, cohesion, mental conditioning, etc. are items to be included with every trip to the range.  It is why, in my opinion, Oath Keepers stresses organizing and training with neighbors.  

Just the opinion of an ol' Hog.

@DaveyE7 Yes, totally. Perhaps we can hope that this is an early sign that their depraved corruption is finally beginning to be exposed and making an impact on the public consciousness? These "powers behind the throne" (to think, thrones in America? How arrogant!!). It is these pretentious powers who are our ultimate enemy, and they appear to be losing some of their control. There's going to be a hell of lot of pissed people wanting revenge if/when that happens.
I saw it a lot when still in active duty. One in particular comes to mind. A supply civilian, nice lady, but she always quotes regs and referenced the regs when she started way back when. She would almost never accept the way the newest version of the reg said to do something. Minor thing but the fact that she did that and got away with it for over 20 years up to that point shows that these people don‚Äôt care. Even the smallest amount of authority they will throw around at will and in your face. 
Great points sir
Great story Davey! Sad but true in my experience too. And I'm a 59 year-old Tennessean...lol Based on that reality, we may be screwed. All we can do is speak out and know we will be judged on the right side of history.
Charlotte area I travel around NC and SC for work all the time every day! Been on Lejeune a few times and Stone Bay also. We are surviving even with an idiot Biden wanna be as governor
That‚Äôs the comfort I have as well that one day people, ALL people, will see what we did as right and just
When I taught self defense I made a point to the ladies (ladies only courses at the hospital system I worked at) to tell them that they needed to make up their minds now that if someone wants to harm you or your family what your actions will be and how far will you go. The room would go silent but inevitably they would come around especially with the scenarios we ran. Like I said before I have made my peace with what would have to be done. I am not a pro tigger puller by any means but I don‚Äôt run and have stood my ground plenty.

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=fjnd59dgajeu4aTNN) I miss him too Buddy, I miss him too.
I do not think that NFA Modernization Act is going anywhere fast.
They are more interested in going for the whole 2nd Amendment with court packing, adding states to give them a permanent Senate majority, legalizing 20 million new Democratic voters, and rigging the elections through 'voter reform'
Why would they do anything with the NFA tax when they potentially have the votes to make the ownership of any firearm generally prohibited nationwide within the next 4 years? They will not consider it a good use of their time
The Texas LTC law is so stupid anyway. Most states that still issue LTCs have requirements that are basically the same as handgun ownership plus a training course (any training course). Texas has highly enhanced background check criteria and a state-mandated course which - honestly - is a joke.
The only reason to have a Texas LTC is to not need to do the NICS check for a firearm purchase. But if you always get proceeded quickly from NICS, you're better off just getting an Arizona license. Less hassle.
In fact, I have always told people in Texas to have a license in more than one state if possible. The reason is simple: if you pick up some bullshit disorderly conduct or assault misdemeanor for defending your wife from a thug, you will lose your Texas LTC. However, Texas lacks jurisdiction to revoke your out-of-state LTC - so you keep your right to carry under the authority of a reciprocal agreement and all you really lose is your right to bypass NICS
@Shooter-OK-NH   I feel an unnerving measure of truth in your simple statement _"Founders would be shooting by now."_ 

Barring a miracle from God in the next 6-9 months, I rather expect the long months and years of prepping will come to an end as patriots transition to mobilizing.
I do think that civil war is inevitable at this point. Everyone has said that it will be about race again.  Bullshit.  Most Patriots don't care one way or another about race.  The second war between the states will be over two things: (1) one-party vs. two party rule; and (2) guns
It'll go somewhere, it's 8 Billion dollars in revenue.  Enforcement will be the other aspect of it.
And yes, prepping will soon be at an end and those who laughed at doing so, we will have the last laugh.
And honestly, I don't think it will last very long or see very many casualties. I think we will see the birth of two mass movements. And I think the secessionists will win this time - because the liberals hate the conservatives just as much as conservatives hate the liberals. It will be more like a national divorce - with some minor skirmishes here any there - but most people just coming to the conclusion that right and left can no longer live together in peace
That will happen sooner rather than later, and I really hope cooler heads prevail and that everyone simply comes to a mature understanding. Just like in a real divorce, there is no need to kill each other. We just need to understand we can't live together anymore and facilitate a means through which everyone can peacefully go their separate ways
Personally, I would divide the nation into 5 - 8 independent nations based on political ideology and have it work like the UN. Common currency. Generally open borders between the nations. Free trade between them. Even a common postal service - and maintain a common military with a permanent strategic alliance.  Washington D.C. would be neutral ground for citizens of all the nations to visit and celebrate their common heritage. The Congress would be restructured, along with the Presidency, to speak for the nations as one voice on issues of foreign affairs only. The Supreme Court would exist only to settle disputes among the nations. The remnants of the old government would have no jurisdiction to interfere with any domestic policy of any nation.
That is how I would do it because: (1) we would still have the most powerful military in the world (and yes, citizens of all nations would still be taxed to support it); (2) no real prospect of war between the new nations; (3) enough of the old traditions are preserved so that the citizens can respect their common heritage and live - separately - in relative peace and harmony.

I am now gonna talk to him about us, OK. He‚Äôs medically retired from the Army

Good morning Patriots,
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
I was a definate no go on getting it for a long time myself. But then my sister a NP, my 87 year old mother, my detective son in law and my teacher daughter, and my wife all got theirs. I was kind of persuaded but also saw that they came through unharmed. So I have gotten my first last week. 
Then I think back to when I was in basic training in 81. They lined us up for a group of shots hitting both shoulders at the same time in pairs of two or three. We had no idea what we were getting. And before we went to Iraq, anti malaria and who knows what else. 
But I don't fault anyone who decides against it. I was there myself and still am at heart.

The distance to the horizon for a hand held is about 2.5 miles.  Add that to the distance to the horizon from the bottom of the base station antenna and you have your answer.   Creating a repeater is a much bigger task than hooking up a radio.  There are duplexers to obtain and tune, controllers and ID boards to program, and Frequency coordination to be had.  It is not a task for a novice.
I am not sure.  I will have to try to create a channel as an ordinary user.
There are some bugs with the current version of rocket chat that I have not got smashed yet.
I hear ya brother. Definitely been there with the double shoulder taps! And got the GG shot twice plus a second small pox vax before going to Iraq. 
how come we're not shooting yet?
No constitutional breaches as of yet, i'd give it a couple more months :-P
Besides I doubt the majority right senate would let that slide 
Thanks jpj. I have almost everything listed in your response, I just am not real sure about the TYT brand radio or TH9800 model.
This radio comes with a duplexer from what I have read in the ad.
Sweet! That‚Äôs all your idea brother
Hey Doc. I haven't seen you on here for a bit, I hope all is well? I know you're into antenna design and also microwave, so let me run this basic idea by you. If you take a focused beam antenna like the Yagi or log-periodic dipole array, place it on end pointing straight up and at a reversed and flared funnel shaped collector / 360¬∞ emitter. It would take some distance tuning and experimenting with different collector / emitter shapes. Like turning the satellite dish theory inside out and upside down. What say you?

sorry, again, i've only just seen this message
@Viper-Strike Look for a used Icom 2820H, it has dual ports, eliminating the need for a duplexer. As far as range, best way to extend the range is height. in this case, elevating the Rx Antenna and making sure you have good coax will go a long way. TX you can get away with that at a much lower height because of the power difference.
crap, looks like they are not as prevalent on the used market online as I thought they were. I'm not sure how well those with the single PL259 work, but I assume they must work decently as the more modern radios with that feature all seem to be single port.
still, makes it easier I suppose. grab an extendable pole, like for painting or whatnot. should get you a quick setup repeat site with around 30 ft antenna height.

That sounds like a good set up. My biggest struggle in trying to decide on my mobile setup is that on one side I would like to have something packable for hikes, but those units are generally only 5 watts. Adding multiple amps in my truck to cover the spectrums from 160m to 70cm doesn't add up financially. With the current sale price on the IC-7100 it gives the most bang for the buck. Maybe waiting to find a deal on a used unit for a pack rig would make more sense where pack rigs are exposed to harsh environments.

Hey guys! Hope you all are well and staying frosty. After thorough reflection on the current situation, I have decided to make a move (from where I now live in Colorado) to Florida, so as to have my best chances of connecting with a strong fellow patriot community. Governor DeSantis continues to impress me with his strong stand against our Marxist enemies, and with his latest move, I now believe he is the "real deal," and will hold the line against further infringements on our individual liberties (witness the pending legislation he is about to sign, which the Marxist are up-in-arms about like I've never seen. I think its going to be the place for people like us to unite with the Governor and people of Florida, and make a final stand for the Republic.

I am looking at being in either the Miami-Fort Lauderdale or Naples-Fort Myers area by the end of this month. I am actively pursuing assistance from the Florida VA and SSVF, but I will need all the help I can get from and of you guys who can assist me in making a Florida OK connection. I will try to transfer my Colorado Chapter membership to Florida, so any guidance you can provide for me there, is appreciated. @jpj @stewart-rhodes

Windy, The Miami are is pretty liberal and Naples is on the expensive end of the deal. Sarasota is very nice and has a lot to do. I live in Port Charlotte, it's a republican town with not as much excitement. Although, homes are going up by the hundreds here now.
Ocala is beautiful horse farm area and Arcadia ia a old farming community, but beautiful and affordable.
Thank you for your input, Viper Strike! That helps. I know Southern Florida (especially Miami) is super liberal, but as I'll basically be starting out in Florida as a homeless/unemployed vet, just living off my savings and in need of asap work, I am a native Tennessean, and may first choice would be either the Pensicola, Tampa, or St. Augustine areas. But from a strictly employment perspective, I'm thinking Maimi or Fort Myers areas may be my best bet to start out at. And yes, I've looked at Port Chrlotte, sounds more my cup of tea...lol Any further thoughts, based on that factor, are greatly appreciated!
Good luck to you in where ever you land in Florida, and welcome too!
Fort Myers & Sarasota are good choices.

Good night all of you Constitution loving Patriots. I'll catch up on the news in the am.
Good night brother
'divide & conquer'?? we need OK leadership to step up pretty quick or this gets worse >>> https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/arizona-oath-keepers-criticize-group-s-national-head-stewart-rhodes-over-members-breach-of-capitol/vi-BB1fJyqP?ocid=msedgntp
"The largest chapter of the national militia group says Stewart Rhodes ‚Äúrefuses to talk‚Äù with them."
Sounds about right.  More interested in the lime light and saying the right things to sound big, but no action.
Haven't had hands on with one honestly
looks pretty similar. without the dual antenna ports
it doesn't do cross-band repeat but if thats not a deal breaker for you, then I say go for it. I would suggest checking the market for something used that will work for you before going new.
60 Minutes is left-wing. So take them with a grain of salt
all the legacy media is liberal
all of it is counter to truth, whatever narrative they want to spin
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=7eBJpgzzGG6Px95eb) This has always been a fault in the "law-abiding" & "freedom-loving" patriot community - when The Law  makes liberty a crime, too many are ready to submit.

The left doesn't seem to suffer this problem
I'm pretty sure the leadership is doing what it can, I've talked to afew
they are under full assault legally. They are up to their rears in alligators dealing with that and issues nation wide
we need to do the right thing on our local levels
talk to Sheriffs and local Reps, get the lay of the land
figure out who is gonna support the constitution and the republic
I personally don't trust any politician, but they aren't all corrupt.
I even know afew dems that are local that completely support what we believe, they just aren't awake
sadly alot are hung up on racial issues and dont realize they are getting used
work on yourself, your community, and Vett our local members
make sure who your talking to is legit
I have 100 percent come across bad actors in this Org and others
Thats why they are only taking membership by mail now
so they can track and Vett anyone who applies
a background check can be established at a base level from that, same process we used in the armed forces
hard as hell to fake credit and addresses over a life time, then that can be used to punch holes in any potential member
Good morning my fellow Patriots 
madmarine4212, Agreed vetting is paramount. I for one thought the application process was a bit light. For example check out the depth of personal information The Proud Boys require. 
Talking to 60 minutes is like talking to the head of a snake, it's going to bite you. And bad mouthing SR to them, WTF! Bad move if you ask me.
I dont see it....the big man himself dm 'd me directly...SR doesnt do anything without a reason...
:clown: 60 Minutes?  Oh, pahleeze.  This is the same Marxist State Media (MSM) program of the same Marxist State Media (MSM) CBS that has been caught selectively editing interviews.

Who are these Oath Keepers who agreed to an interview...AND...I can only *assume* that they were smart enough to be making an independent recording?

I don't believe any of this until the above two concerns are addressed.

Of course we have differences among OK members and groups.  Conservatives and patriots are fiercely independent folks. But the naivete and lack of judgement among these members is staggering.

When I became aware of this recording that was in the possession of an individual who was researching the National Archives for an unrelated project, a message was immediately sent to SR who then proceeded to write the article.  If anyone is interested in the 'back story' I will post more.

Please show your fellow Oath Keepers that you were smart enough to make an independent recording of the entire interview and it will be provided to OK National for publishing.  Please show us that you did this.

Sorry.  I haven't been here for a few days.  Alot of stuff going on
wish I had one but I have a hunch it's going to be addressed real soon in light of the upcoming 60 minutes piece airing 4/18 .
Agreed we cannot divide ourselves for them. It‚Äôs MSN so they spin themselves going to take a piss
Maybe the whole salt shaker
I‚Äôll say this. SR was on here once the chats came back up and did communicate with those on at the time and in private dm‚Äôs. I would bet he looks at the chat here and others if he has time from dealing with all of the legal issues and helping our guys for on the whole 6 Jan thing. But I will repeat something he has said in the the last 2 interviews I have seen and that is we should not get hung up on one man but embrace the ideas we all hold dear because in the end those are what unite us. I would say it‚Äôs what brought us here in the first place. Hold the line, prepare what you need to prepare. I have learned a lot and had good discussions with all in here. That‚Äôs what we need to do right now because We The People WILL have our day and time as the Patriots did at Concord. It may be a kinetic battle or in the political arena or another of Gods choosing. Just be ready. I do wish he had more to time to address the troops and I am this just added to his plate. At least the lame stream media idiots out up a picture of our folks, a woman, a white man and a black man it looks like. People will see that and question the whole white supremacy narrative, not everyone but some. Hold the line brothers and sisters, hold the line

Which we had such a damn rainey winter I am glad for a little dry
We're still worried about one last frost 
Our guy up in CT posted pics of snow on his van. Did you all get snow?
Can you believe those Arezona OKs going on 60 min and bad mouthing SR
I didn‚Äôt watch it but saw it. They need not do that, but like I was saying I wish SR would get with us a little bit more. Sometimes you gotta address the troops directly and not through alternative means
Hopefully he got with them
And straightened it all out the last thing we need is discourse
Need unity ALWAYS
The left does
But I will watch it just to hear what was said
True indeed. Or he should at least have someone like a number 2 speaking with the troops and filtering out issues and concerns and getting back to him directly 
Yes and what I really, REALLY have been wanting for 8 years is a more organized command structure 
I was just thinking the same thing. We should have platoon leaders at the local level and 1st sgt at the state level that way things van flow

Anyone at the Health and Freedom Conference today?üòé
It's long overdue.  It should have been addressed a long time ago
Personally, the only "conference" I want to be at today is the _WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE ENEMY LIKE CRAP THROUGH A GOOSE_ conference.
I'm not familiar with the impasse between AZ leadership and National. 

I wonder the fallout from the upcoming 60 Minutes show.  This is NOT the time for airing personal grievances on the national stage, a program hosted/edited by the ENEMY no less. I see all downside and no upside, but I leave that up to the good Lord.

Hah! I didn't even KNOW we had leadership in AZ. I've heard from NO ONE. I've been rattling the cage, but here I am, standing alone in Scottsdale holding my dick wondering where the F is everyone.  This chat plat isn't going to stay up forever.

Time to relax, it is Sunday after all. 
If a white man goes into a bar on the black side of town and hits on black women what's going to most likely happen? Cut throat, shot or badly beaten by a group. If/when a black man goes into a bar on the white side of town what's going to happen? He's left alone and usually picks up a white woman.  Most blacks hate on whites, most whites don't hate on blacks. Facts like this and that blacks commit more crimes against whites than whites do against blacks is proof but they are hating on whites. Stats don't lie or have opinions. Also around 67 % of blacks do not have a father in the house to bust their butt when they need it which results in their male father figure being an older black running the streets which causes way to many to end up in the prison's and graveyards. Trading a father in the house for a welfare check so mom doesn't have to work isn't working out to well for blacks. I've made a good living solving problems. You can't solve a problem if your afraid to address it and implement the solution. I've seen way to many black kids not have a fair chance at life because mom traded a father in the house for a check and everything else free that comes with it which is mostly funded from white tax dollars. Before democratic president Harry Truman created the welfare act most blacks owned land and were married. God over man, man over women, women over children is the order for raising a child to be an asset to the community not a burden . My best man at my wedding was a black man I grew up with. No kid deserves to not have a father in his home to keep him on the straight and narrow. Politicians are scared to address it and remedy it so the cycle continues. I don't like to see a kid or old person taken advantage of. it's not right and only yeild's negative results.
I made a very interesting discovery on YouTube today regarding comms. I've been researching what to put in my truck, leaning towards Icom. One of the two Icom radios I've been considering is the ID-5100A dual-band 2m-70cm. This video shows a guy doing what is called a MARS cap delete, remove two diodes and you open up access to the MARS Military Auxiliary Radio Service. Well on this radio when you do that you also open up GMRS access. When they do it at the dealer they must cut that access via software. Interesting ha!
Hmmmmm very interesting. Something you could do on your own?
Yes very simple. He shows in the video and then there are many comments from people who performed the mod with happy success. One even mentioned that he didn't even need to use a soldering iron, he just got a small screwdriver under them and they popped off clean.
Very good points all of that rylandrebel! The Dems have been trying to keep blacks under their thumb for decades and now the results become more and more obvious. My former partner I worked is black and he thought the Dems passed all of the Civil Rights legislation in the 60‚Äôs. I had to go online to show him the official vote tallies on different things and pointed out a Dem president may have signed them, but the Republicans passed it with almost no Dem support, just enough in some cases. Here in NC the pistol purchase permit you have to get if you do not have your CCW permit to buy a handgun is a holdover from Jim Crow. It even says that on Wikipedia! He didn‚Äôt know that either. They as well as all kids now are not taught correct history for fear they will wake up. Then they would see what has been done to them.
I would think removing diodes would be that easy. Nice idea!
Busy busy now Miller time !
I just finished talking about it with an online acquaintance from Gab who has his MARS license. He said it looked to him like it opens that radio up to TX on all of its available frequencies. So you would have to be mindful of not pumping out too much power on the FRS frequencies that have the 0.5 watt limit. Or just stay off of them.
I'll shoot you the clip
This radio also does DMR and has GPS

:grin: After many years with Civil Air Patrol I wanted to get back into flying.  Spent months researching the best option, and it turned out that Flight Simulation is just about as real as it gets.  Especially with ATC Simulation like at https://www.vatsim.net/ 

Anyways, I installed a loaded Elite PI-135, which is FAA approved for logging hours at flight schools.  I log hours, but since it is home-based, they don't count in my log book.  

My favorite choice is the King Air B200.

My youngest is 31 oldest 40. All my step kids. My wife robbed the cradle, well not really. She's 4 years older.
Democrats have rigged the system to keep blacks suppressed and addicted to welfare.  They and their race hustler allies (Jessie Jackson as an example) have used propaganda since 1968 to convince blacks that the evil white man is their enemy and that only the Democrats can save them.  Now the hate that started within the socialist Black Panther and Nation of Islam movements have percolated to the top of Progressive consciousness and have begun to overflow into overt tolerance of the BLM movement. The reason Progressives not only tolerate, but encourage the rioting, looting, and burning of inner cities is to use that hate as "evidence" of their twisted narratives.  Socialists, especially Leninists and Maoists, believe in the necessity to destroy society completely before building a new socialist foundation.  Part of that destruction process necessitates mass slaughter of those who will not submit to reeducation efforts, e.g. the religious, capatilists, classic liberals, libertarians, and often any demographic that the ruling elite simply detests (namely Jews).
The hate of the white man is just one part of a greater machine that Marxists have been building up since 1915.  The machine has been running in overdrive since we the people showed the world that we would no longer accept the status quo, e.g. Trump.
I have 2 with my first Ex who is German. They are 31 and will be 29 this year. My second ex‚Äôs kids might as well be mine because their dad is a scum bag convicted drug dealer deported to Mexico. They are 31, 29 and 27. The 2 that live with us are 12 almost 13 and 10 almost 11. That‚Äôs the one special needs boy, my son we had together will be 4 in May and is autistic 
So 2 special needs boys 
So 8 total, 3 biological, 5 step and 2 grandchildren to boot!
Wow you are a glutton for punishment. I'm on my 2nd wife, I'm her 3rd husband. She proposed to me. I was all done with marriage after the first fail. But after she proposed and I told her we were living proof that it's just a piece of paper. Well the air got thick around us for a week and I gave in
Yeah I am I have a 3rd ex that we never had kids. She just wanted to party so this would be number 4 if we get married.
My first 2 marriages fell apart because of the military and I used to joke with people to make SNCO in the Air Force you need a good golf handicap and multiple ex‚Äôs. Lol
Ya they get sensitive about things
All excellent points zephius!
Very very true
They both stepped out on me, one I did not know about until later and one sent me Dear John emails on my last deployment, 3 to be exact. 1 sentence per before she spilled it. 
That sucks. My last wife pulled that shit to. Broken hearts are a bitch!
For me this is the last marriage if it happens and however it ends. Been looking at travel trailers to live in just in case lol
And yes that deployment really sucked because it was 1 last trip before I retired for them. I was on track for E8 and 9 because I had filled all the spaces except 1-2. I was giving that up for them. 
She felt bad and signed over her rights to my retirement
Lucky on the retirement. I gave up a direct assignment to Ft Schaffner Hawaii and promotion to E6 because she was home sick. Wish she was straight with me and told me she was sick of me. 
But life takes its paths, we're just going for the ride
Ouch that sucks. You are right we are were we are supposed to be. And I am glad I am out. I could not have handled it these last 10 years being in with Obama and all the bs with Officer Corps and their stupid games. 
I was ready to drop nearly $800 on radio equipment today. And then I ran that GMRS hack by the guy with the MARS license. He has a Kenwood TH-D74A hand held that he's been thinking of selling. He's asking 450. The best HT ever made. 
I've always been attracted to gals with kids. More mature and I like kids. My first wife had a 3 year old from a guy in her high school when we got married.
She asked me if I would ever want any more kids then she got pregnant! 
Oh boy. I guess I was lucky there. Turned out I shoot blanks from a botched hernia repair when I was 8 weeks old
I wonder if because of all the shots I got in the military if that‚Äôs why my son is autistic. I am not an anti vaxxer type but with all this stupid Covid vax bs I have been wondering 
Lol I got cut a year later
Let the VA do it
So now I am shooting blanks
I hear you, there is definitely something going on with our kids these days. Way too many issues. I have to send you a video of a nurse and how her opinion on vaccines changed 180¬∞ from what they taught her.
 It's buried in my Gab, I'll get to you later
I have listened to Dr Tenpenny and that got me thinking. I started getting the more oddball shots after my 2 daughters where already born but way before this one. I had 2 GG shots within 10 days, anthrax series plus 3 boosters, a boat load of shots to go to Vietnam on a JPAC mission which most never get. 
This clip is on child vaccines and what happened to her kids
Great I will watch it send it over! My queen is home so gotta make her dinner! Later my brother!
Lol idiots 
Made her dinner now she‚Äôs in bed
Took a bit of searching but this is a powerful personal experience of a Pediatric Nurse and the hell her children went through with child vaccines.

Good morning, let us look for light at the end of the tunnel. 
Hey good morning. It was very eye opening. We never had any incidents of any type with my son. He was and always has been very calm. He has his moments now but that is due to the therapy and making him do things he needs to do to learn
I see, but yes eye opening video for sure 
What are you up to this morning?
Sad situation indeed but....no riots, no cries of say his name, no pandering. More proof of a communist plot and take over.
Barely up. But the weather is good today so putting latches on the Brazilian  walnut fence I built at the end of last year 
Laundry day, finish up monthly bills and get us ready to go out of town to TN next weekend 
Sounds good. 
Might get a workout in too if the boys let me 
I'm a ways off from being up to that. Everything I do still hurts.
Yeah I can imagine.
How‚Äôs all of that?
One day at a time
Yeah it‚Äôs hard getting hurt. Feels like being worthless sometimes 
Yes but it's a good day. I'll make the most of it

I have cartridges/adapters for all of my weapons -- rifles, pistols, shotguns.

What I really like is that one can practice *Instinctive Shooting*, especially with the pistols.  I place small targets in various locations and practice - absolutely no sight usage.  It is amazing how adaptive you become with sufficient practice.  Then verify with live-fire at the range. (I get asked, "How old are you?" :flushed: )

The targets are not your typical larger targets; rather small (~3-inches).

I think its too late. Our only hope now, is if the red states were to secede, form a strong new union, and eject the Marxists and illegals from their midst. The updated Constitution would require all the remaining able-bodied patriots (of whatever race or gender) to swear an oath of loyalty and serve in a citizen militia, at least in a reserve/support capacity. I believe that this has a good chance of happening (although not assured), which is why I'm moving to Florida. Sadly, this forum is the only place I even see any serious discussion of these things. Until we take action bolder than theirs, the Marxists continue to hold all the cards.
Receiving increasing reports from multiple (historically reliable sources, such as this one) that Canada has become a full-on Marxist police state. Total censorship, crawling with Chinese operatives and now preventing their people from leaving or coming into the country. Sound familiar? Not a good development, folks....
https://youtu.be/YlgoZxwUaR4
They are getting more bold by the day 
*Ceding states is not an option. *

Red states ceding from blue states, or vise versa, is not on the table. Give the enemy NOTHING.  The Left has been taking and taking and taking for decades. 

For some patriots the idea of ceding from "blue" states seems the reasonable solution. They wish to avoid bloodshed. 

Indeed, few have the stomach to do what is necessary to restore the nation whole. I understand the sentiment.  However, I ask you to consider the following:

1)  It's too little too late to take a measured approached. We passed that crossroad decades ago and DID NOTHING.  
2)  We aren't doing this for ourselves. We will stomach the inevitable horrors so that our children and grandchildren do not.
3)  We didn't pick this fight. The Left will simply NOT live and let live. The Left brought this fight to our doorsteps.
4)  If we do not stand now, we bend the knee forever. 

Americans bend the knee for NO man. (I bend the knee---BOTH knees---and bow to the floor ONLY to my Lord and Heavenly Father.)

_"Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?"_
I'm game! Let's roll then. What are we waiting for? I would stay and fight for Colorado, if there were any evidence of what you say being true here. Most everyone in my state--Democrat and Republican alike--have all but ceded to the new Marxist regime. We need leadership, and we need it now!

Hog :cowboy:
I thought you were busy packing for Florida?
I am!
Because Colorado is lost
Why the sad face?
I'm still here, hoping against hope, until I leave.... I don't want to leave. I have over two years of my life invested here. But I am being forced out by the system. No access to health care or income opportunities here, due to the ever-expanding medical tyranny (and pending "vaccine passports"). Florida sounds like it may be a gathering point for the future of freedom-loving Americans, who still believe in individual rights.
You've got time. Pack and move. Hook up with patriots in FL and prepare to go hot.
Oh, and don't forget to watch tonight's episode of 60 Minutes.
We can plan to re-take the blue states once we have consolidated our forces under solid operational leadership. This girl ain't ceding anything. But we have to do something now that has a chance, to begin to turn the tide.
Very likely how the later chapters will unfold.
Good topic. Let's take it to the General chat room...
Here we go again

https://youtu.be/GQ8TlyZ5Eo0
Greetings, Florida OK Chapter! I am a female U.S. Army veteran and Tennessee native, currently living in Colorado. Just putting the word out that, after 14 months of zero signs of patriot push-back against the growing tyranny here in Colorado (and believe me it wasn't for lack of intensive outreach efforts), I have decided to cut my losses before its too late and move to Florida by the end of this month. With the solid leadership demonstrated by Governor DiSantis being the deciding factor for me, I feel that Florida holds the best chance--for not only my own survival--but as the focal point from which our Republic has the best chance of being restored. I have no connections in Florida, so I appreciate anyone on the ground there interested in connecting with me, either here or via Signal or Protonmail. 

My greatest concerns are the overpopulation issue--particularly the troubling concentration of Marxists in Southern Florida--as well as the continuing prevalence of businesses in Florida that still enforce the shame muzzle, thus limiting my chances of finding employment, as I refuse to wear masks, take vaccines, etc. As of this moment, I'm not committed to any particular area, but will be leaning toward a more rural area on the Gulf Coast; and hopefully one with a strong, active OK presence. That said, I think its clear, from a overall  individual liberty standpoint, Florida is the place to be. Any practical advice/feedback in my quest is much appreciated!
windy - i'm @SAM84 (db) over at gab - the site is getting better each day, adding stuff all the time! i paid for a pro acct to get certified & access to all the venue levels
Watched the first 30 seconds and almost threw up. What the hell has happened to our good ole tough neighbors to the north? 
Liked that video about setting up a repeater using Baofeng radios. Pretty neat
And I agree KAZ, I will not bend a knee for these idiots only before God. And I am not dying on my knees either. Period
I would say they better watch out the Guard May shoot back but I don‚Äôt think they would
Amen @DaveyE7! The Constitution is not a suicide pact. We need to unite, say our prayers and fight
Hi DaveyE7, it looks like it can be done with more than just Baofeng radios. But I am the farthest thing from an expert on the subject. I would expect we'll hear from jpj on this. He's the expert on this.
Also this appears to be only a simplex setup.  
I am sure he will say it is illegal in some way but it is good to know how to do jic 
I think the only part that is not FCC approved is if you used one of the Baofeng UV-5As like many of us have that are not FCC certified. But using that module with FCC certified HTs would not be against any rules I don't think?
I wouldn‚Äôt think. Yes my Baofeng is not FCC certified either, lol
Right so those are great for SHTF where the rules don't mean shit any more. These are cheap enough though. I'm going to get one to see how it works and practice setting it up. But I would still like to hear from jpj on it first. Sometimes they make it seem like things are simpler than they actually are, and then you find that you need more to make it work.
In my humble opinion everything we hold dear from our families and loved ones and their collective futures is worth defending to the hilt. If I did not believe that I would not be here. We just stand United and stay the course. We are here at this place and time for a reason. Read an article a few weeks again that Gen X is the key to saving our nation. Well guess what I am....and probably most of us. I say we make that come true.
True. I was hoping to have time to fool around with the Baofeng a little more. Didn‚Äôt get that time today unfortunately. Plan on taking all the radios on the trip next weekend anyway so maybe I can get a little me time and figure it out. Pretty good at figuring stuff out since most times at work I have to
I have some YouTube programming how to videos saved that I hadn't spent the time focusing on yet. I'll forward them in a bit.
Well said, sir! Its all we can do. I suppose being a Gen X'er myself: "We Mutually Pledge To Each Other Our Lives, Our Fortunes And Our Sacred Honor." That time is upon again upon us. We must seize the initiative, and take control of the narrative.
And we need to pickup some software to make the mods to them that we were talking about yesterday. 
The diode removal?
No sir, I'm being vague because on the HF & VHF/UHF chat groups here they have highlighted that illegal mods are not permitted to be discussed. Accomplishing the same results as the diode removal on the Icom but on the Baofeng, the Baofeng is done through software.

Ahhh I think they have spoken about before
Sorry fed the kids and their dad is on the way to pick them up
I admittedly have procrastinated on getting this done. It's good that we are talking about it though, because it makes me realize I need to get off my ass and get it done. So I'll get the lowdown on the software and hook you up.
Funny when we were talking yesterday I thought it was Sunday. One of the hazards of being retired! 
Agree w u, Andyj. Local resistance is the way.
Lol no that‚Äôs today but it‚Äôs all running together for me
Ya I mentioned something to you yesterday about it being a day for rest
Lol my weekends are never rest. I hope at the cabin it will be
The guy I was talking to yesterday that has the MARS license, totally lead me to believe he was selling me his Kenwood TH-D74A handheld or HT as they call them, (handheld transceiver). But today he was oh no I'm not selling that. You never know, he may have been 8 beers into a 12 pack? Oh well back to my last plan.
Lol yes I remember you mentioning that. Maybe he was 8 into a 6 pack
Hmm?...I guess I'd just rather be  "locally resisting" from a red Southern state than blue one, if I have the choice. Not very promising odds in the blue states.
What's that beers and shots!
Lol I am outta whiskey need to go over to SC to this big ass liquor store and restock! Beer too!
True that windy. Here in NC we are basically purple right now a mix. Damn frustrating
I just found out this afternoon that the larger of the two Icom rigs I've been looking at is being discontinued. So now I am thinking getting that while I can make more sense. It's the Icom IC-7100. It covers 160m-70cm. So every HAM band except for the ultra low 630m & 2200m and 1.25m (that falls between 2m & 70cm) which is not so common. The other Icom is that one  we watched the video of the guy doing that diode delete on. It only covers 2m & 70cm.
Are you gonna set this up in the truck as a mobile unit of base station
By the way that MARS guy said after watching that video he read that someone had asked if that mod would give you access to the CB bands. But as he pointed out, CB is in the lower frequency range, way below that radios reach. Which made me think, if the same mod was done to the 7100 you would most likely get GMRS and CB all in one rig!
I have a Kenwood TS-2000 base at home. All band 100 watt
The IC-7100 & ID-5100 are both meant for mobile. But of course any mobile can be a base as well.
I see and that would be good to have all in one. 
The more I hear you all talk about it the more I want to get into it
She‚Äôs a joke and a worthless pos 
I still don't have my HAM license. I just got the two study guides for the Technician & General class licenses last week. Another one of those procrastination things. I've had my TS-2000 for several years. But talking with each other boosts the motivation. 
I've heard that you can take both the tech and general license tests back to back for the one fee if you are up for it. Of course you have to pass the tech first.
I have a new 50 watt mobile GMRS coming in a few days. I want to get my truck set up strong 
A few years ago I picked up a pair of 21' pneumatic masts on a dealnI couldn't pass up. I may fit one in the bed of the truck to boost range when needed

All of this going on with the left and yet militias do nothing but circle jerk and talk.
I have been preaching about this for awhile now...have a friend that travels for his work.told me in 2018 their were chinese troops all over salt spring island....

Anyone else watch the 60 Minutes' segment on OKers?
The 60 Minutes segment on OKers was a hit piece on OK Nat'l leadership. As expected. Rhodes was depicted as the founder of Oath Keepers who, since the 2020 election, has become aloof, dangerous, and losing his way with the flock. Typical leadership hit piece from the Left, attempting to sow division within our ranks.  

Hahhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhha.  

I have to laugh.  The Left is so stupid, so full of themselves, so obnoxiously arrogant. As with the father of lies, pride is their undoing.
Why would Arizona Chapter of OKers, Jim Arroyo, air personal laundry between he and national leadership on NATIONAL TELEVISION? On CBS of all places!
There is a lot more that can be done through software though as I had previously read. This clip covers that.

60 Minutes segment and transcript...
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-capitol-riots-oath-keepers-militia-2021-04-18/
At the end of the segment, 60 Minutes host, Sharyn Alfonsi, stated: _"Sources tell us prosecutors are looking to build a case against Stewart Rhodes and possible separate charges against the national organization."_

Heck, I'm surprised the FBI hasn't nabbed SR yet. I was shocked and relieved to read SR's posts on our website after January 6th.
@stewart-rhodes   If you ever find yourself in my neck of the woods---Scottsdale, AZ---you'll always have sanctuary, protection, and a place to stay at my home.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=99vyySDWEQ5fLtnvL) This was a hit from within.  Jim Arroyo is arrogant and has his own agenda.  It has rendered the entire state chapter into chaos.  I hope it gets addressed soon.  We need to be unified even if it means a divorce  my 2 cents
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=8EkeJdQcYgM6dC2nN) That's right, Scott-Railton, this will NOT go in the direction you and your Marxist comrades were hoping.  Not at all.
If they want blood on their hands bring it on and the problem will be solved for good.
@rylandrebel   History shows the hands of the Left are drenched in blood. The blood of millions.
Information is now starting to flow out of Russia regarding President Vladimir Putin's upcoming address to his nation's Legislature. According to the LEAKED (not verified yet) infomation President Putin is going to announce that Russia will accelerate its decoupling from the "decadent" West during his historic speech on the 21st of April, Moscow won't participate any longer with Great Resets, Liberalism, Climate nonsense.

He is allegedly going to tell his countrymen this is "The birth of a globalism-free nation." I think this is why the left hates Russia so much.
Very interesting. Thank you for sharing this.
I don't understand how we've so abruptly reached the brink of civil war. As that paragon of virtue, Rodney King, asked in the midst of the LA riots that his beating sparked: "Can't we all just get along?" The system wasn't perfect, but as a working-class white girl for most of my life, the system impressed me that it was working so smoothly and equitably for a broad spectrum of our society. Actually, by 2019, I felt we had achieved remarkable balance in our society, given its complexity. Definitely no "white privilege" here! I must have missed the memo. There was plenty of drama, for sure, at least both sides could agree to disagree, and they certainly respected the free exchange of ideas (censorship was virtually unheard of). So what changed? In her very clear and insightful talk today @ThePatriotNurse said that societies through fairly predictable historical cycles, and that what we are entering into now is the shift to the "equity cycle" where the world's wealth is being transferred from the older (Baby Boomer/Gen X'ers) to the younger generation (Millennials/Gen Y). Notice we keep hearing that word, "equity" being beat away at by the media. It is during this equity part of the cycle, she says, that major social upheavals are almost guaranteed to happen. I thought she did an outstanding job of shedding light on the historical forces at work, directly impacting the current challenges we now face. She concludes by gaming out the direction the general situation is likely to unfold, based on that analysis. Interesting stuff! @Keeping.AZ

Good morning you beautiful Patriots and also to the not so beautiful. ;^)
Hey good morning. I will definitely watch these both! Thanks for digging this stuff up.
In Charlotte as well!
Yes this is good stuff 

Big job today long drawn out day. Argh!
Your day job?
Yes my day job today
Lol like that picture 
Just read the transcript of the 60 minutes piece. What a bunch of crap
You ain't shitin
Little pieces of Zello conversations and they think they made a case. Propaganda at its finest
I think they should be kicked out!
Unfortunately all of this and the 6 Jan bs create a real headache for National and all of us
Their leadership yes. The rank and file be given the option
Stay or go 
But above all we need to close ranks like the left does
Either way totally unacceptable 
Yes for sure
In the 8 years I have been a member SR has not changed his message only our actions have changed but they are consistent with the messages
I was just thinking. Being "60" minutes who's to say they didn't alter the transcript to fit their narrative? All the more reason to steer clear of MSM groups like that
Exactly. They do it all the time. They can edit footage however they want and show what ever they want to do the agenda.
I think the AZ chapter is impatient and went crying to the media. I said that SR does need to get his message out to a wider audience but not 60 minutes 
But it also shows us that they fear us...
So we are a threat 
Good morning all! Stay strong and United! Fuck 60 minutes!
Clearly multiple mistakes made with this. Doing it without sanction. Going to a liberal news group. Possibly bad mouthing SR.
Yes after all the warnings we got about don‚Äôt speak for National. SMH breakdown of discipline 
Alright gotta get ready to hit the road to the job. Talk later brother
You can imagine that the Injustice Department will use that against SR in any attempt to charge him as being complicit 
No we all can't get along because their are two spirits good/god and evil/satan.   It's the spirit in people's hearts that makes this impossible. And the greed for power cause power is money.  So the left steals, lies and cheats to get the power. We will prevail as always cause we are of GOD.

Noone ever gave me a job or promotion cause I'm white. Noone ever added points to my college entrance exam cause I'm white. Noone ever paid me to have babies with no father in the home so I didn't have to work.  The only privilege white people have is paying the bill for blacks to pop out babies so often they keep one under three years old in the home to keep the welfare check and food stamps coming in and their $6 rent bill. Then it's on to school where they are behavorial issues and free lunches and medical care then onto the meals and health care in jails, then onto the prison's after a tax paid court appointed attorney, then the funeral expense all taxpayer/we fund.  We have spent trillions of dollars trying to help them but you can't help someone who has been convinced to dislike you and that you owe them and wants to live off the white mans tax dollar cause he thinks it's owed to him. They are so easily brain washed by democratic politician's telling them that all their problems are caused by the white man so the keep them mad and when someone is mad they can't think logically and see they are being used.  Their problem is no father in the house to bust their kids ass so he will have the character to grow up and be an asset to society not a burden. People today look into the past during the slave days and say you owe me money, NO we don't cause you haven't been a slave and you can't live in two time periods, today and 200 years ago. Slavery was legal then so nothing illegal was done. When someone looks backwards they get depressed, when they look into the future they get anxious, when they live in the present they are content and at peace.  Only the blacks have this issue and only blacks don't have a father at home 68% of the time, see a LINK?

@rylandrebel   You're describing the modern Democrat Plantation in America. It's a tragedy. It's a tragedy for all God's children who fall prey to the Left's trap. The Left preys on human weakness and works regardless of age, race, and gender. Millions of innocents the world over have fallen to the evil of the Left. 

Hold the line.
@jpj   What's the latest from SR and national leadership?
That's true but the democrats sights are pointed to the majority of people who can vote for them and those are blacks. I grew up as a kid sleeping over at my black neighbors house in 1971 then they would sleep over at my house. They had a father at home and were and still are some of the finest folks i know. I've shot many thousand games of basketball with blacks, one's with fathers in the house and ones without and they are like daylight and dark in indifference. I'm a problem solver who led his class on SAT and CAT test from 1st grade thru high school and ran the streets as a young man with some rough people so I'm very well rounded. I worked in public education for twenty years, I hope I've seen everything but I know I haven't. When i was young i thought people would get smarter as time goes on but no they get dumber and more corrupt.
Look about for *unity*.

Where there is *disunity*, division, disintegration, discord, and deception, therein you will find EVIL.

Where there is *unity *you will find in the hearts of men harmony, love, and integrity---therein you will find wholeness or Holiness, GOD.
Happy APRIL 19th, America, patriots, and OKers!

246 years since the Shot Heard 'Round the World rang out from Lexington Green.

12-year birthday for OKers!
There's less to no unity cause the democrats do not want it and most blacks believe everything that comes out of their mouths. Democrats keep them fatherless with money for babies out of wedlock which causes the kids to run the streets and be raised by older males who also have o father to keep them in line. Democrats want them angry and hating so they can't think logically and see they are being fed bullshit lies for their vote. Spare the rod and spoil/ruin the child. No one owes anyone anything. There can't be total unity until they see they are causing their own problems by having kids out of wedlock cause until they see this they blame the white man as they are told by the democrats.
I got to go picks up parts for WORK.
Until later I got to go,  think logically and live in reality not what you wish it was. Pray.
Hi, jpj.  Happy April 19th to you and OKers!  What's going on at national? Does Stewart have plans to address members?  We're over due for a briefing on national and state leadership, legal matters, and internal divisions.
Thee are 18 million veterans of the Armed Forces alone in this country. For sure. There are 35,000 members of Oath Keepers. Possibly. So if responsibility and integrity aren't just two words in the dictionary we can look at, maybe we need to take a close, hard look at this.....?I'm in there, you're in there, where is everyone else....?

Good morning Patriots!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
You ready to see what this illegitimate government and its co-opted military has to say about 18 million veterans visiting D.C. intent on reestablishing Constitutional government and national news that actually represents WE THE PEOPLE, then let's make the time to see that that happens.....? Talk is cheap, bullets are relatively inexpensive. I doubt a shot would need to be fired, or would be. I know our government is corrupt, and so do you. Criminals NEVER willingly return stolen goods to their rightful owners. That's all I have to say about that.
Good morning jpj,
I was hoping that you could take a look at this and give your valued opinion on this HT repeater device? And weather it is as simple as they make it seem? 
https://www.amazon.com/K-head-Repeater-RPT-2K-Walkie-Baofeng/dp/B08HYMVNHB/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=Two+Way+Radio+and+Repeater&qid=1618764876&sr=8-9
If Oath Keepers is willing to start organizing a march to D.C. to celebrate Memorial  Day, honoring the kind of men who were willing to fight and die to not only create this great country of ours, but to insure it stood strong and prospered n this world by protecting it against ALL enemies, foreign and DOMESTIC, I'd be willing to help organize those 18 million veterans and other willing participants that reside here in Michigan and make the trip to D.C. as well. Being an Oath Keeper means nothing. Keeping the Oath does.. Let's do this thing. We make history. Or just talk.....
Men and women.....my bust!
Let the planning and organizing of this event take center stage in the national and local news. People with a fervent desire to  bring our government back into the reins of the citizens, not a bloated bureaucracy run by purchased politicians.. Let them know we are coming, and we mean business. It's our country, our right, and truth be known, our duty! And that is what will happen. Or............you're looking at it!
@wildman1959 I have read through your full proposal here for action, and am in total support of it. If the Oath Keepers organization is to maintain any relevance to its stated mission, going forward, we cannot just continue to do nothing. Since January 6th, we have been totally paralyzed and evading our collective responsibility to mobilize against a clearly-defined domestic enemy threat. And this, while our cities burn, our children are sacrificed to deadly "vaccines," and our country transformed into a Soviet-style dictatorship. I have been advocating for such robust action since the beginning of the globalist Marxist insurgency, but it seems to have fallen on deaf ears. Not just here in the OK chat, but in every patriot quarter I have reached out to here in Colorado over the past year, to the point where I had almost given up on it being anything but a social chat (nice as having some outlet for patriot fellowship may be). However, as we chat our way through the destruction of America, I am constantly forced to wonder, as I am sure you have, as well: "What are we supposed to do? Just wait for them to burst through our doors for the implementation of  their "final solution." Not happening here! This shit ain't going away if we don't stop it now.

So, I was happy to see your well thought-out post here, which is the best proposal I have heard to date, to actively begin the process of restoring our Constitutional Republic. I believe it's now or never for us. I am happy to connect with you via DM or Signal (and that goes for any others within our organization), and am willing to play any part within my means, to help make it become a reality. (On a side-note) kudos to you, sir, for that little revision of your phrasing, emphasizing the equal role of women's contribution in upholding our oaths to our Constitutional Republic. I am a Cold War-era female Army veteran, and while not a PC person by any means, I thought that was pretty cool of you to be so self-conscious and respectful, as such). 

That said, I'm game! What do we have to lose? What are we waiting for? Let's move on it and make it happen, before its too late! This is not "business as usual" time. We now face an imminent existential threat to our nation, greater than any time in our history. We have a sacred obligation now, to act quickly and decisively, to unite all freedom-loving Constitutionalists across the country who are willing to fight. It is time to activate and renew the pledge of our Founding Fathers, by whose courage and sacrifice we were able to create a nation based on the values of freedom, liberty and human dignity: "We Mutually Pledge To Each Other Our Lives, Our Fortunes And Our Sacred Honor"

Hog:cowboy:
Well I did it! 
I just spent $1,205 on the Icom IC-7100, two antennas and mounts & software.
Today is Patriot's Day.  On April 19, 1775, trained, dedicated, and resolute men stood up to tyrannical government at Lexington and Concord.  Our ancestors' response to gun control and confiscation was physical force and resistance with personal firearms. They had arms equal to or exceeding the government personnel attempting such confiscation.  

The Patriots were well-trained, well-equipped, physically hardy, and knew the history of Western civilization.  Does this sound like you?  If it does, keep honing the steel.  If it does not, own it and fix it.
Awesome! More reasons and reminders for us to act now. They didn't have any more resources or tactical advantages than we have, other than their resolve to fight for their freedom, whatever the price.
Yes you can set up a cross band repeater with two radios and not much more, especially if they have VOX like the UV-5R, but there are a multitude of reasons the above is not a real solution.
Here is the deal.  The "device" there is simply an audio coupler for the radios.  The UV-5r has VOX which means it will transmit when you talk into it without pushing anything, if you turn the vox on.  The "interface" is just to match the speaker out level from one radio to the mic in level needed for the other radio.
This has maybe $5 of components in it.  Probably more like $2 at quantity.
It will not give you automatic ID (legally required or everyone has to ID for the repeater all the time, assuming they know it's call sign).
Also being cross band it means the propagation will be different between TX and RX.
It does eliminate the need for a duplexer however.
But do you think it would serve the purpose as a simplex repeater on the cheap? 
Of course it limits use to only dual band radios that can program tx and rx in different bands.
It would not be a "simplex" repeater.
simplex means the use of a single frequency.
Let's put it this way if I wanted a repeater, even a field portable repeater that is not how I would do it.
If I wanted a field portable repeater I would probably go for UHF and use a mobile UHF duplexer.
I would then go for a better quality of radio, even if I started with hand held units.
Ok, because DaveyE7 was asking about it. And even though, as you say there is probably only a few bucks of parts in it, if it boosts range when you need it it is $cheap
While I have you?
Did you read about the pitfalls of the uv-5r at http://shaken-not-stirred.tekhq.com/blog/index.cgi?mode=viewone&blog=1488684251 ?
Perhaps I will get the funds to do a portable repeater build and do a how to.   Would be nice to be working as I would already have done it.
If I were going to do a portable repeater build I would go for a much better quality radio as the basis.
Repeaters have to be high up.  Being high up means there is usually other transmitters near by.
I just pulled the trigger on the IC-7100 160m-70cm and was wondering if you know of any sites to buy fiberglass antenna builders kits. The lower bands won't be the first legally available to me and I would like to try building my own HF antenna. 
They have to be able to operate in a high RF environment and still rx the desired signal while not being interfered with by signals on other frequencies.
In general antenna are not built from fiberglass.
Fiberglass can be used for housings.  and fiberglass tubes are often used to house colinier antenna at VHF/uhf.
for HF you want to look at wire antennas to start.
I will read up on that. I  do realize that the UV-5R is bottom of the barrel. 
If you are getting your ham ticket pick up the ARRL handbook.  It is the bible for radio communication used by hams and professionals alike.
I have  been around boats my whole life. All they have are fiberglass antennas
Actually they have metal antennas that are inside fiberglase housings.
Those housings are sealed to keep the metal antenna from corroding.
And I thought it would do away with interference from the aluminum or stainless steel 
VHF marine antennas are colininear antennas generally speaking.  On power boats they tend to be 6-10DB gain.  They are sealed in fiberglass tubes to keep them stable and non-corroded in the harsh environment.
Well of course the internal antenna that part that performs the RX & DX is copper, aluminum or steel. 
Small power boats also tend to have 23 foot "fiberglass" HF antenna as verticles.  Those are really just wire running vertically inside the fiberglass tube.
Sailboats and larger vessels tend to use wire antennas for HF.
My sailboat has an insulated back stay.
Not to beat a dead horse, but aren't some mobile CB antenna fiberglass? 
The 96 inch ones are a wire embeded from base to tip in a fiberglass rod.
the shorter ones are a coil embed in a fiberglass tube.
I'm just looking for a durable housing to run my antenna through. Preferably one that doesn't impede on the performance of the antenna 
I am bugging him!
He is busy with legal it seems.
Any housing will change the tuning of the antenna.
You will need to tune the antenna, put it in the housing check it, take it out and retune.
For what frequency do you want to put an antenna in a housing?
You are now the Big Man On Channel.
I'm not sure if you caught my post back to KAZ last week. I think he was pulling my leg about running wires up a tree from my truck for HF. I told him I was thinking about installing a 21' pneumatic mast that I picked up on the cheap a few years ago. He didn't respond, but I actually have two of them.
He was not pulling your leg.
Most landmobile HF antenna are 8-13 feet.  13 is the max as otherwise you will not clear bridges.
Frequencies 160m-28m ish
When I stop my land transport I haul up wire antenna in trees
I think building a "fiberglass antenna" for hf is not a useful thing for the use case you describe.
Start learning about antennas.
:thinking: Maybe that should be the Only Man On Channel?

Thanks for establishing...

Hog:cowboy:
For instance at 160 meters you need an antenna about 240 feet long to be effecient
Whith 21' to start with and I could easily add a fiberglass or aluminum extender another 20 or so feet I would have plenty of room for an inverted V
Yes a mast on your truck that allows you to support an inverted V would be nice.
Obviously I would not be motoring at in that configuration 
It can be as simple as some telescoping pipe from home depot that you pin together after you telescope each section.
There are also 33 foot pushup fiberglass antenna supports for sale at most major ham suppliers.
Start reading
There is much out there.
Agreed. Especially using cheap HT's.
You mentioned back some time ago that coil loaded antennas don't offer plus dB. What is the lowest frequency that you think I could shoot for in a vertical without load coils
http://shaken-not-stirred.tekhq.com/blog/index.cgi?mode=viewone&blog=1488684251 is a must read for anyone that is counting on a UV-5R or similar cheap chinese radio.
I'm referring to something that would have to be kept down until parked. Or at best under 13'6" from the ground 
This was a not-so-thinly veiled threat to those of us that refuse the poison jab, that he is ready to move on forced administration and "vaccine passports" to force this shit into us. We cannot stand idly against this threat.
I got ya there. So for relatively fixed antennas I should be keeping above 10 meters 
There are mobile antenna for HF.  Just know what to expect.  Grounding and bonding are key.
So is loading coil placement
Start reading.
The ARRL handbook has chapters on HF and VHF/UHF antenna covering mobile and fixed base antennas.
There is also the ARRL antenna book.
jpj, remember that hard coax I told you I have. I was thinking of building an HF collinear antenna with it. It is 1/2" and the outer shield is solid copper. 
https://gab.com/SSGTGMAN/posts/106093074600226804
Let's look at that..
It might make a mighty collinear 
For say 80 meters you would be talking an antenna in excess of 360 feet for 3DB gain.  How do you plan to support 360 feet of hardline vertically?  Please do some more reading before you toss $$ away on things that will not work or will be marginal at best.
There is over 120 years of history to learn from.
Lovely looking hardline.  Best used for VHF/UHF feedline to an antenna or building a VHF or UHF colinier, perhaps after experiments and experience building some simpler VHF/UHF antenna like the 1/4 wave whip, the 5/8th wave vertical or the coaxial dipole.
I totally get it on the lower frequencies. And this is stuff I already have for free.
Well use it for what it was intended.
It's fire proof to
It would be a waste to use it the same as cheap wire in HF antenna
Ok I'll be adding the ARRL antenna book to my tech and general books. Thanks for the chat
Also the ARRL handbook.  Different book with tons of valuable info on all aspects of radio comms.
Correct me if I am wrong but the shot heard around the world came when patriots who were prepared, organized and trained defended themselves and the general citizenry with the foreknowledge of a direct attack made upon them. Gun confiscation. That was the line in the sand and the activation of true self defense that transitioned into an aggressive offensive fight for patriots. The battle against tyranny. One Nation Under God.  
Looking back at the many accomplishments of OK, standing guard against protesters who were burning down businesses and committing violence against law and order abiding citizenry. This is the type of honor and dignity of the true patriot. Search and rescue during large scale catastrophes, delivering life saving aid, food water, safety and protection to those victims when it really counted. This is who OK is. Those who were prepared with organizing, training and skills were the ones on the front line taking care of business. The Home Guard. Are you ready? Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.
Ezek 38:7

Stand ready.
:slight_frown: The original post and replies could be copies from 2011-2012 on the old Forum.  Obozo was in office and looking like he would easily secure a second term.  The call was for a massive March on D.C., expressing virtually the same arguments/logic.  It was met with severe critiques/criticism from some OK National/State Officers, and a devastating rebuke from SR.

I supported the mission objective, but strongly opposed the strategies and tactics.  Mustering one's entire force in enemy territory - especially where all means of protection are outlawed - seemed extremely risky, to say the least.

In support of the mission objectives, I authored a proposal with much different tactics, and called it _The National Rally of the Fifty Sovereign States_. 

Simply put, Oath Keepers and fellow Patriots - with State Officers/Legislators - would meet on the same day and time at every State Capitol.  All aspects of the Agenda/Program would be conducted in unison by radio communications.

It garnered some strong support with people volunteering to coordinate his/her State, and adjoining State if there were no OK Officers. (Remember, this was when OK was very new, and the existence of State Officers was sporadic, at best.

Anyways, I could go on-and-on with many more details, but suffice it to say that while I support the mission objectives, I still strongly oppose mustering in enemy territory.

Just a bit of OK History...

I joined.  I figured it was an Announcement sort of forum
Yes it is
ok good!
I just set it so that everyone goes there when they log in so no one will miss announcements when they are posted.
Every so often i post the "If you are a new member.." so people know to do that. We have had 2 so far read that and come into Georgia and say hi.
Windy, thanks so much for your welcoming response to my remarks. Your insight and ability to express it articulately surpasses my own. Stewart sent 2 letters to Trump, both accurate and to the point about exercising the Insurrection Act. Call the veterans back to active duty, mass arrests, military and la enforcement
military and law enforcement working in concert to stop government in its tracks, openly, publicly, to take a serious look at government that government is unwilling to do. A Fresh Reset, if you will. Capable concerned citizens from all quarters could have stepped to the plate in a responsible fashion. Now we will have to to it ourselves. I hope we can use Memorial Day to ignite a fire under every American patriot to make the Fresh Reset this nation sorely needs possible...
I hope your day worked out alright for you. Sometimes the equipment we have to deal with can be a bitch  to service. 
Shit boys I was finally able to get back on here. I will continue to monitor. Have a good one MT patriots.
Hi @Moonshine Welcome brother! Tennessee Army vet, trapped behind enemy lines in communist Colorado here :slight_smile:
Washington DC statehood is up for a vote in the house this week.  I think as soon as tomorrow perhaps.  SEND YOUR CONGRESS CRITTER AN EMAIL TO VOTE NO.  The founders were specific about this in the constitution.  Dems want to sidestep that by cutting the size of the district to be just the capitol and the whitehouse.  They are doing it to try and pack the senate.
Welcome moonshine   Alabama brother in arms here hit me up anytime.
Yeah the democratic president that signed it didn't have his arm twisted when he did, he had Jesse Jackson and other black leaders standing behind him smiling from ear to ear, hinting to the blacks "look what i got for you all". The democratic president said now we will have the black vote for the next 100 years but he didn't say black. Blacks should of known then they were being hustled. It takes a while sometimes but ones evil ways always surface sooner or later.
Congress is voting on DC statehood this week.  Perhaps tomorrow.  I urge everyone to message your congress critters today to tell them to oppose the DC statehood vote.
Here is my message to my congress critter:
I am writing you today to urge you to vote no on statehood for Washington DC.  The founders were very specific that the district was never to be a state, but rather a distinct federal district.  To try to make it the 51st state by decreasing the official size of the district to only include certain federal buildings goes against the intent and wisdom of the founders and is simply  a move to bring the United States of America under total one party control and create a totalitarian system much like the USSR.

As a United States Navy Veteran who served during the cold war I am both sad and terrified by the direction our democratic party and the democratic majority in congress is going.  My oath to support and defend the constitution against all enemies, both foreign and domestic obligates me to inform you that any move to make Washington DC a state is an attack on the Constitution of the United States of America.  

Laws which are repugnant to the constitution are void ab initio.
END OF MESSAGE
@artynyc & @ironmace welcome.  Introduce yourselves.
I am sorry I missed you previously.  It has been a busy several days for me and I have not been on line much.
don't really think i did much of an introduction here when i started posting: i've been around (OK) for years (observing)... Vietnam Vet/US Navy, retired @63 from the commercial Maritime industry & became pretty much useless from a 'go do something' after retiring UNTIL ALL THIS INSANITY BLEW UP ON THE USA!! ...i came off the bench, strapped on a Liberty Tree membership & began to stretch the ole muscles & GEAR UP!!! Soooo, the 'stretchin of the muscles' isn't going as well as an old man would like BUT HOT DANG DID I EVER GET GEARED UP!!!

(1-stop shopping for first-aid OR last rites!!!) LMBO!!!
Thanks for having me lve been a member since before the shut down of servers I'm in upstate ny as a former sheriff deputy I can't say I was happy with the OKs that rushed the capital that's wasn't a smart move on their part. I hope we get smarter. 400 against thousands is unwinnable.
It's going to be addressed VERY soon from what I hear.
Thanks, FN9.  Will you accept the office of AZ Leader if offered?
Stewart may be dropping in later tonight
I think we have a number of leadership material here, including yourself
Me? Hells bells, I just want to light fires of freedom in the hearts of patriots and pull triggers. :blush:
There are plenty of roles to fill!
AZ has to basically start from the ground up.  We'll see how Stewart & the BOD want to play this out
If you, SR, and national leadership feel there is a need I should fill at state or national level, naturally I would be honored.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/AZ?msg=YSCFBir5pu3HPCmtm) It is April 19th after all.
Goodness, Stewart. DELEGATE. DELEGATE. DELEGATE.
@ironmace the folks that went into the Capitol identified in the press as Oath Keepers mostly were not.  The ones who were went in without knowledge or sanction of the folks on the ground in DC who were running the security for folks at the Trump event.
The one who has pled guilty already is a heavy metal band frontman who was actually there with the Proud Boys.
Where upstate?  I have to make a trip to the Saratoga area in the next couple of months.  I would love to meet you if it can be arranged.
BTW no one in leadership is happy that any OK got a serious case of the stupids on Jan 6.  Sadly some did, but we can not and should not toss them under the bus.
@denbo drop into the #TX room and say hello.  There are some really good folks in TX doing good things, but like everywhere more work than they can handle.
So folks I encourage you to send something along the lines of what I sent to my congress critter to yours.  They all have web page contact forms.  Find it and use it.  Congress Critters hate to be on the wrong end of things.  If they only hear from us on this issue then they will understand what the right end of the stick is!
If you are USN Cold War sailor feel free to steal my piece above in total.  If you are some other branch or era then modify as needed to personalize for you.
How are we doing on the counter attack?  Do you have your posts done to be approved yet?
Yep that is what some of us are telling him, but he has been burned by bad state leaders in the past, so he is being very careful about delegation.
Said he would show in chat tonight, but have not seen him yet.
hi jpj! started off in the TX room & ended up here... made a few posts but it was too quiet! LOL... i see some warm bodies have been posting but for some reason the left column isn't showing unread msgs in TX room just here in general - i'll give another shout out to the TX-P's - be nice to put something together, get something rolling!!
Not approved yet. Will add to my to-do list this week.
howdy again brothers N sisters!.. don't really think i did much of an introduction here when i started posting: i've been around (OK) for years (observing)... Vietnam Vet/US Navy, retired @63 from the commercial Maritime industry & became pretty much useless from a 'go do something' after retiring UNTIL ALL THIS INSANITY BLEW UP ON THE USA!! ...i came off the bench, strapped on a Liberty Tree membership & began to stretch the ole muscles & GEAR UP!!!

(1-stop shopping for first-aid OR last rites!!!) LMBO!!!
I will poke folks I know in TX to jump into the room as well.
I think I may have a window of oppertunity to register and start working on my approval next week.  Got a reprive on deadline I was working against.
Great!
How's the job hunt going?
If you find me on my back, start with first aid, please.
Redfox there is no leadership here accept what we ourselves provide. I'm calling a RED ALERT. With lamestream media doing all they can to distract and divide us you may not be aware of whats going on unobserved on the other side of the world. We are at a hair trigger point of going to full on Nuclear War. The Russians and the Chinese prepping for attacks in Ukraine and Taiwan as we speak, they will use those pretenses to start what will be an attack on the US mainland. If you are not as prepped as you can be you have barely ten days from stated jumpoff.
Interesting video https://youtu.be/4Kq-lyySptk
Not as good as I would like, but have 2 second interviews set for this week.
I'm between syracuse and utica if you come I'd love to meet up with you and chat. I don't ever toss brothers under the bus  I'm just saying let's be smarter and operate within the limits of the law.

sup, where you from?
hey there, your in Iowa?
hey there, just checking in, hows life? I want to get some like minds together, start rebuilding things in the valley. 6239103999, shoot me a text and I'll call you, Mike
North Carolina, You?
Georgia Originally, out in arizona now
got alot of fam in SC
ya'll hang in okay there?
oath keepers has two factions here, those guys on 60 mins broke away awhile back
There will always be factions. I've seen it happen so many times I've come to expect it. As long as the principles and goals remain the same I dont sweat it. Just try to remain in touch with in some way. At some point those differences will become irrelevant.
tried to hit you up on signal. heard its compromised by Israeli intelligence, my friends from the farm informed me on that,  don't know how much they are sharing with the federals, might consider a move
eventually, true, at least I hope so
You a Vet?
Honestly this will go kenetic eventually, sadly
Seems like all my friends are though
well there aren't many trigger pullers besides myself I've met in here
as in career military combat arms
I do have a guy here in AZ who was pretty high level command in SWAT and tact teams, never was in a gunfight
you can text me on signal at 6239103999, Mike
or call me there
I know your were an 82nd guy too, 2/508 Fury from the sky brother! I served with several medal of honor recipients, I was at Korengal,Restrepo, QRF for Keating, went through some special hell. Infantry Plt Sgt. Retired from wounds
Still kicking ass, working on building a range here in AZ for training LE and OK members
friends with the best in the biz, and alot of PMC guys, all good people
would love to talk, give me a shout if you wish, thanks for your hard work and service
There are many that train for that eventuality, but hope to never see it happen. After 911, I slid off the fence and became very capable over the following years by association with Vets, groups, Swat, whomever was willing to prepare others. I hope it never comes to a fight, but I know I'm very capable of defending my family and community.
I just want to fix the shit storm that AZ has become, very little leadership here, talked with Kait abit, she speaks highly of you
smart, you did the right thing
I'm working on building a range and training center
I have a business prospectus I want to show you. Some very highly placed Flag officers on our side have looked at it, and a few wealthy business men on our side
I'd like to send it to you
I dont see a way out of the fight, I think its gonna keep building for awhile\
gradual slide into anarchy
like Matt Brakkens books
hopefully Jesus shows up in abit and they can have the mess they made
We forget the lessons from our past. The Civil War was about family fighting family. Id rather pass away than see that. Looks like its headed that way though. The Left has gone off the deep end pushing everything toward that. Its absolute insanity. Do you listen to the Patriot Nurse? Shes has a good handle on many things. A student of history and many other things. She just had a video where she talks about Cycles that happen in our History. You should listen to it. We are in a bad place in two different types of cycles.
Yeah, she and Reid hendrichs are good people
Yeah I know many in the industry,served with afew
I fought with 7 medal of honor receipents before I retired, was in all the books and movies made recent
had a good career in uniform
From my heart, thank you for your service. I hope many have expressed that to you. At one time I was deep in church until some bad things happened there and in family life. Slid back for quite some time. Our current state of affairs, not just here, but everywhere, has got me headed back to church. The future looks like the end times.
Too bad your not in Tennessee. 
I do not see myself as a pacifist. I cannot retreat from horrors being committed on innocents.
Well God loves you brother
he is always there
he promised, never leave or forsake you
so dont worry about God, just fix you
I've done alot of that
Believe me, I found comfort in a bottle after my career, I was shameful
absorbed in my pain, phsyically and emotinally
got to remember God has been a man, thats why we have jesus
he knows exactly what we feel
Its been the Vets that convinced me to look back to God. Of all the people in the world around me they are the ones that walk the walk, but can talk the talk better than most.
yeash, I've been dead afew times and saw the other side, its real
flat lined three times on the table from wounds
literally touched Christ and he held me
saw his hands with holes that were scrabbed over and crusty with blood, can't heal
trust me its real
saw my grand parents for alittle, they were young again
some friends I fought with that were killed in battle
even saw a man I killed in battle
he must have done something right, he was there
but he wasn't in heaven proper, like across the river in the city
I don't know why, but from my minutes there, I gathered it was his beef
not heavens
what are you doing for training?
work hard on drills, and medical
you are a leader in the org?
I see you on all the time
I just leave my PC on most of the time
I've reached out to Rhodes, sent him some comms, he responded with a number
talked to a former leader down here, i know Arizona has issues in leadership, I was an Infantry Platoon Sgt, was career retired
I'm trying to fix things here, looking for some guidance from on high
there aren't many men with my combat experience,I'm trying to reach anyone who can help
sounds like commie BS to me, some of those people are bad
Hey brother that‚Äôs great! Sounds like a nice set up! Hope it works for you. It was just a long drawn out day. 1 piece gave me a bit of trouble but it got done!
Yeah, don't really have anything for you on that front. I just deal with Iowa. I'm basicly all thats left in the state as far as I can tell.
I'm headed to get some rack time. Good luck
Thank you for that. At the moment, not a damn thing. Been out of work since January, so I've been working on a Cabin while living in it. Dont recommend that to anyone. Its a pain, but its saving me money. Its been chewing up most of my time. May be going back to work soon. Will find out this week. The rest of my time has been spent trying to network Patriots together on a group neutral forum. If I cant get them together to train, at least I can get them in contact with each other for mutual support when the need arises. Local training groups rise and fall quickly. I've been involved in them long enough to see this happen all the time. People dont commit to being prepared until too late. They have to be IN a bad situation to really "get" the need to be prepared. Then its too little, too late. When it gets real, be prepared for a huge influx of unprepared people that want to get up to speed FAST.
well i've been ready for awhile
just can't get people to commit
same here
i have chow,weps,ammo for 30
could go about 20 years if we wortk it
well not for 30
really want to move back to the south
probably have more people there
then I could hook back up with decent people
Probably not
None of them ever really are
good folks that actually stand for the anthem and love freedom
its hard to find men among men now
Thats good and bad. Lots of good people in the South, but lots of bad in the cities
well thats everywhere
surprisingly here, all the vets and black and brown
besides me
but they are all die hard conservatives
Thats what I like about Vets. Color dont mean shit
really confuses the antifa and what not when they see a sea of black and hispanic in veteran shirts with OK and 3 per on their gear
bunch of marines and soldiers in full battle rattle just looking
and some proud boys and bikers
plus phx police commander, shes hard, black woman, she doesnt put up with shit
we hand out coffee and drinks to the cops, all on our side here
Yeah and thats really all they have to do. Just stand there prepared. They would be incredibly stupid to attack them. From what I know they havent yet.
Ahhhhh no thank you little joe. Take your vaccine and shove it in your way out of the White House you idiot
They attack cops, not vets in gear
well its different here, the cops know we'll back them
we openly frisk as militia here and the cops dont stop us
you come in into the crowd and look odd your getting tossed
they know that here too, but the liberal ones try to keep their distance
the cops just run a perimeter and let us handle it
I just keep them in starbucks and pass word
mostly peaceful,  sounds like this devil dog needs to flush out his head gear
Before I get off this forum and get to work on the cabin, check our My Patriot Network. Its the countrywide network I've been working with to get people in touch with each other. The NC OK network is represented there.
show me show land near by and Ill buy and do the sam e
rather have good neighbors
gonna sell here next year
I'm just a good olde rebel
lol! Anywhere not in a city.
Gen Sherman burnt my fams home in Georgia, fuck them all lol
Yeah mostly peaceful, shots fired is peaceful now? Who would have thought that...
And good morning fellow OKers!
Anyway got to go. Daylight is burning here

Hey glad you got back with all your digits in tact. 
The only easy day was yesterday!
Gooood Morning to you all.
Yut Yut SSgt
coming soon to america
remember were all racist and terrorist
Yes that mostly peaceful crap is from him watching too much BS MSM with buildings burning behind them saying it's a mostly peaceful protest. He needs to flush out something! 
well, trust me I've been on the inside of this, my NDA looks like war and peace
its a gradual decline
the left is by any means necessary
most of us are good, live and let live
I'm a bible guy, don't hide it, this is all from hell
we all need to network
ham radios,signal, whatever is clean
this place is a trap, I've found feds on here
even went to events with them, and they thought I wouldn't see through their BS
giving me intel dumps on OK and 3 Pers
even went as brazen to send me pics later of events, and id hide my face
silly feds without time in the field
when harvard sends dorks to the academies
and yale
madmarine4212, 
I'm with you there my brother. 
they are awful at it
even came back at me with pictures
got me vampire covering my face
like a finger in the eye, I know who you are, nanny nanny boo boo lol
trying to get facial rec
for me, its mutually assured destruction, I could topple two presidents on their face
worst case, I'd die Clinton style, two rounds of suicide
back of the grape
but that won't happen, without a fury of violence
üò≥ üòâ
I talk, I lose my benefits
nothing like a dead man switch!
Yes that is true.
one thing I'll say here, gen Flynn is a good man, was my ex wifes Co
met him, awesome guy
only POG intel officer I've ever met with a Ranger tab
Yes he is. He got the raw end of the stick.
I watched the barry railroad out the best officers we had
few left, the damn few, but we still have some great ones
SSGT, obvious you served
Corps? or AF?
Army, I figured SSGT, for corps or AF
instead of SSG\
I retired Army
Yes Army. Twice 
did some time in the Corps before
got out and reup'd?
I just don't know how to spell. lol
or guard?
6 in the 80s then that Patriotic bug had me back in again after 9/11
right on brother
nothing wrong with it
I served from 98 to 14
medically retired from wounds
No need more of it
didnt want to be a 1SG, it was my next stop
felt infantry plt sgt in war was the best I'll ever achieve
didnt want to deal with beans and bullets past my boys
It starts getting messy up there. And political in a minor way
well I knew at that point i was headed for brigade or an S shop
no thanks
My point
when I left my platoon i was like, done here
but all of my little turds made it to E6 or higher
one is about to pin SGM
I was medically discharged 
I was too
Iraq got the best of me
yeah Afghan did me in after the gulf afew times and afghan afew times
You 100% to?
im at 280
paid for 100
Yes it's not 1 for 1.
i wish it was
id be making 4 star pay
100 only gets you 80 if your really lucky 
I had enough stacked over 16 years
280 on the books, permanent everything
I got cut off short of 12
they fucked you
you should be where I am
you would have been career
That is
yeah they really mess with guys
when I retired in 14, they just looked at my stuff and didnt ask much, but my war record and awards, they didnt say shit
I was infantry and spec ops
and served in the worst fighting of the wat
This guy is a idiot and playing his part
don't forget Bill gates
Lol some cuts as always but yes all accounted for lol
Good old Doc Bill
my girl, works in congree
she took the ''vaccine''  broke my heart
I was a wrench, then in charge of the allide trades shop in Iraq. Off base to recover equipment and work with the AF EOD. Up armoring ...
by the way, a friend from the ''farm'' works at georgetown medical near DC
dont take any of that shit
thats cool SSGT
I helped you guys rebuild 1114s and RG31s on my time off
I wanted my vehicles solid as fuck
my men poured over those things with yours
we rebuilt 2 1114s, and 2 RG31s
There was no up armor for me. I had to create it.
from cat kills with mechanics
me too bro
we fab'd everything
we built a TADS sys and launchers from scrap
for the TOW missiles
its was epic
I learned how to use a plasma cutter from the E6 shop chief
we made epic shit
Had to go with 1/2" mild steel. I tested all the steel that the supply guys brought down from a mill in Bagdad. 1/2" was the only thing that stopped what it needed to
Some of my favorite reset days overseas
playing Bball with the mechanics and turning wrenches until dawn for the nest mission
I'd take out the mechanics so they could get promotion points and get their CABs and write them up for combat missions as voulunteers
put them in the gunners seat
Came up with a way of armoring those fiberglass body Freightliners. Can't remember the nomenclature. 
so I could out my grunts on the ground
we were so short manned
Cool. I would have enjoyed that
I even had Ranger cooks on my guns
so they could get their CABs
hey bro, I was a great Plt Sgt
would have been a hellish 1Sg
Sounds like it. Yes
I used to make the wives interview before marriage
id go look at their homes, work places
That's great
had a guy,young E4 hit the jackpot
made the fiance sit down with me and the SGM
DaveyE7, day off today?
when she did it and was great, I was like keeper, dont blow it
married at 20, their still together
they are about thirty now
still Army
Good deal. The way it's supposed to be.
yeah, it works on the rarity
All too rare
yeah, i married an SGM's daughter ,she was military too, thats been done 10 years
No dentist appointment then a job afterwards
Home this morning 
Waters should be put down! 
that woman is broken, soft in the head
She is off her damn rocker and old Nancy keeps defending her what a fucking joke
I'm Norgewian,Scottish,and West African, race has nothing to do with any of this
I'm with one of those now. Need to move on. But I'm 61 and physically broken more days than not.
Only what the libterds spin up
their Commies bro
my fam lived in SA during the 80s and early 90s
Yes they are
I saw it all as a boy
I'm 42 now
its all from hell, straight commie
same happened in Africa, i saw it
And they have been slowly and steadily enacting their plot.
now its operational
Republicans are too f-ing nice
were on the final count down
no they are in on it
some are
believe me
seen it
Many are. That has shown true lately 
the things i could unleah
I'm a fan of mortar
in Afghanistan I killed more Chinese and Russians than I ever killed Afghans
some Iranians
They wouldn't know which way to turn until they burn
I believe it
thats why I always called for He and VT, and WP
from the mortars
They are in on it with the libterds
you can run fuckers, but you will burn
gonna make some irish coffee,br right back
Well good chewing the fat madmarine4212
nothing like a Kuerig brothers,quick and easy
wish I had one of those over there instead of KBR electrics and an English kettle
shot of powers or Jameson, right as rain bros, rain as rain
hey we got to start working
man let me see, I think I have some old shots of our COP
SSGT let me see if I can drop them in here

public opinion is right on
Where WKNC lives is a great area
commercial break...
Spot on SR and madmarine
we won't get anywhere with current Gov, has to happen between people and local Gov
on the federal level, its a train wreck
gonna take love and faith locally
cling to what they hate
TRUE, the Left is bleeding credibility with the public by over reaching. However, the impact will have a limit.
Spot on SR
well, there are the stalwarts on both sides, the battleground is waking up the people who aren't awake to the reality
Yes we need more to open their eyes!
Is that John Shaffer even a member of OK?
education is key
I have been saying you have a lot on your plate sir, address is when you can. 
we need less men and women in battle rattle and more of us in gov and law, in our communities reaching out to schools
veterans need to get off their asses
be examples of leaders and heros
Yes I do üò≥
Yes! Look at that video of the Marine/EMT that was posted. 
yeah hes a shitbird
They are being re-educated as well
and thats exactly what they have done
As a lot are getting that way
Thanks Barry asshat!
sadly this started decades ago
Yuri Bez
my friends on the ''farm'' say its all real
Yes don‚Äôt forget Ashli
yeah that was a bad shoot, I've been giving dirt naps for 22 years, complete murder
commercial break...stay tuned. 631-359-9366.
ive been subject to so many 15-6 investigations
that was murder
Yes it was
I've killed many, i don't know how any of those cops sleep at night
I've never lost a wink over a kill, cause I did it the right way
even refused to fire to protect innocent life
rather than hit a kid or woman
Her family should persue it in the civil court
if they even can
They are I believe
Trying anyway
the media has already made sure everyone is convicted
gonna hang together or seperate
We need to convict the MSM
i'm cool with that, at least i'll stand in front of God and say I did my best
Propaganda central
Yes convict those idiots 
I dont mask, wont ''vac'' either
*If you just joined the chat, we're listening to a LIVE interview with Stewart Rhodes on Liberty News. To listen in, simply dial 631-359-9366.*
Dear Congresswoman Velaquez,

I am writing today to request you introduce into the house a resolution to remove Maxine Waters from congress.  A woman like Waters has no place in our congress, or even in a civil society.

For years she has been calling for violence against people with different political beliefs.  She previously called for attacking members of President Trump's staff when in public.  Most recently she has threatened violence if there is not a conviction in the recent shooting incident in Brooklyn Park.  

This country has no place in it for a member of congress who is attempting to influence the outcome of a pending legal action.  There are laws against threatening a jury.  Ms.  Waters recent statements in Brooklyn Park can also be directly tied to the drive by shooting which targeted MN National Guard members.

Ms.  Waters has crossed state lines to engage in criminal activity.   As a Veteran of the United States Navy I have a duty and obligation to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, both foreign and domestic.  Ms.  Waters is clearly a criminal and a domestic enemy of the constitution and needs to be removed from congress.
Nope no mask, no vac and not taking my guns period 
****END OF MESSAGE****
I just sent that off to my congress critter.  I urge everyone to do the same.  Send a similar message to your congress critters.
Mass used to be a great place. Far from it now!
Truer words have not been spoken SR
:pensive: Ashli Babbitt

FYI:  Norm Pattis, a very successful trial attorney, who has been described by the media as being "brilliant and audacious" and is considered to be a "legal top gun," has filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain the name of the Capitol Hill police officer that shot and killed Ashli Babbitt.

Hog:cowboy:
Hope it works. Rest In Peace sister
:grin: For DaveyE7

Hog:cowboy:
What else do I need to touch on, in this interview?
Im thinkin your nailin it boss!
Yeah, stepped away for a sec, did you Red Flag laws?
Good one Hog!
Sounds good to me sir. You are hitting on all cylinders SR
the implications for vets with PTS
there are cases
Ammo isn't an issue, I know people at Hornady
they are storing it
they are waiting for the prices to peak
Yep, burn loot and murder, spot on
get out of the cities
we should co locate all together in communities
develop our own
home school
build our own
have the village raise the kids and have real family again
Yuri Bezmenov
hit on that, get people to look at his articles and interviews
The judge in the case said that too
my sister teaches at ASU, she has her students write on the constitution for English classes
what does the 2nd amendment mean to you
free speech, founding fathers
I dont know how she gets away with it
Glad she does it
Arizona State?
yeah shes a great woman
My brother went there for broadcast journalism and is in accounting now
Godly woman and a great patriot
Great to hear there are some left in the education system
A Jordanian Prince is her colleague, he buys me Arab coffee at the Islamic Madrasa
married to a great midwest girl
hes King Hussien's boy
Arabic coffee love it 
King H is awesome, good to Israel and Christians
Not sure if it would have been successful to invoke the insurrection act. I think Trump knew he couldn‚Äôt
met him twice
Ill never run out...casting and reloading....im even workin on a primer recipe as well as my own powder...casings are the thing that might be problematic
Great interview SR
yeah I reload as well brother
Great job big brother! 
mostly 7.62x51, I was a sniper, used to be number 12 and 13 on the all time list on distance
my two longest kills in Afghan were 1400ish my second was around 1451 meters
Death from the tall grasses
Your givin me a mean on man
well I was up high shooting down into the watapur valley by COP Honaker-Miracle
caught a 3 man RPG team early in the morning
my team had been sitting in through the night
the 3 came out of the Mosque where they slept
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=urtv6QHRQuivF8ztt) Touches on it.  But ran out of time to dig deeper.  That could be a whole show.
they were playing soccer and I was approved by for the Kills
they were about 800ms out, playing with kids, I refused the shoot from higher because of the kids
Mortars were our problem daily at Balad
i let them walk out
they went into a creek, caught the honcho through his liver low
he was the first
he crawled for awhile
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=C3EamNPhbipbPeebN) Yep.  I need to have those interviews posted on our main website.   Please post some of them here.
on it 6
Please I would like to read about him
my friends at the ''farm'' I've known for 30+ years validate all this
they have all told me the Gov is the two face god, Janus
theres our side, and theirs
Good interview, Stewart.
Thanks madmarine
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=q0MWOfq8Cp3uBLf8B) Problem was, he should have done it last summer, when the communists were in open insurrection.  He missed that chance.  No doubt because his advisors lied of him and told him he would lose the election if he did.  And thus if he had done it after the election, he would have been accused of only doing so to remain in power after ‚Äúlosing.‚Äù
always, our watch never ends brothers and sisters
BUT, he should have done it anyway.
Yes and yes
I'm a direct descendant of Dr Limon Hall of the great state of Georgia
I brought it up simply to point out that now we will have to do it the hard way.  No way around it.
my whole family has defended this country since before it was
Knowing the leadership of the military is as they are they might have turned on him
Mine too....
But I agree we will have to do it the hard way
the military is a train wreck brother
I know 
Pisses me off
my old PL is a team leader in 3rd SF
took ninth place at best Ranger
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=mcaAr8tjK7pX4pYgX) No doubt.  He should have purged the top brass, just like Obama did.  BUT, if you‚Äôre going to have a fight, have it with Trump as commander in chief rather than a ChiCom puppet.
dude is a stud, he wants to resign
The rank and file, especially the NCOs, are still predominantly conservatives and patriots.  For now.
look at Gen Hamm's old interview after bengahzi
I think he lost his resolve at the last minute
Failing to invoke the Insurrection Act was a gross dereliction of duty. Nevertheless, I count Trump the Great Revealer because he exposed the Deep State to the general public.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=utiiSM8wKKP3nyiYc) That‚Äôs right.  Exactly
He lacked the courage of his convictions in the end
he was forced out, after refusing to fire on Americans
I personally hold every NCO and officer accountable at this point
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=6rFEjKSRWfuvAvxwE) Agree 100%.  He did do that.  The masks came off.
if they are true leaders they would say no
I would
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=ZXmSa3yWniP8twST6) Yep.
my Daddy held high clearance, used to work for Cheney
We are still in a battle for hearts and minds in the ranks.

Ok. Off to do my morning PT.  I‚Äôll check in later.

My PT today is trying to finish up one of my two gate latches. I had to build this damnd fence out of Brazilian walnut! And then of course I couldn't just put a simple latch on it. 
Later my brothers & sisters.

Lean green killin machine.....my grandkids wouldnt know me

Good morning Patriots!

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
died last september from a brain clot
out of the blue
one of the last Vietnam Vets still on active duty
caught me how to walk mortars
and really mess with Taliban
ballistics.....a wonderful science
he taught me hold to reload too
learned ballistics from him
I need to learn reloading.
its easy,
all in the books
Have the equipment, but have not done any reloading.
but then you have to learn the human body
except to help dad when I was a kid
soft tissue
learn what can break up
cant do ballistics on a round that breaks into a million pieces
powder loads
I had some friends that became hitmen, went back to Mexico, became Sicarios
have plenty in PMC's
Well he should have I agree we‚Äôll never know if he lost his nerve or just knew something we don‚Äôt. I did my part to lead when I was still in and hopefully my troops are good leaders now and not swallowing this bull shit. 
I didn some time in that myself. but never sold my soul
Viper --- sorry for no reply for so long -- If you're still on here please reply so we can arrange quick call and then should be able to get you plugged in.

No bullet..no ballistics
I think we're past the point of worrying about criminal ballistics investigations.
interesting on modification of the 556.  Sadly you can not do that with 7.62x39 as they are steel.
Damn things go right through most anything.
You have 4 bad guys in a line I bet it would get all 4.
Bet 3 letters r lovin these convos
Fuck em....feed em fried fish eggs
7.62 can do plenty
Yeah 7.62x39 is crazy,
x51 does some great stuff
pretty much my go to round
x39 breaks up between 300 to 500 yards
but honestly my go to combat gun is American built Ak
the right barrel and reciever is key
the guns I build are Epic, I can give a parts list
mine feel like a 22LR on recoil and shoot 1 moa ish
but its hand built
I can do it for about 2k, makes a 556 gun feel like a bb gun
and its accurate, honestly a good rifle you only need 200m of accuracy
stand off is great if you have the METTC
everyone who says AKs aren't good guns haven't been against them in combat
I was given my AK by a friend who could not take it with her when moving.
I find the AK to be too short stocked for me.
you probably have a warsaw stock
I have not sighted it in yet, just did some test shots at about 25 yards in the woods behind my camp. Plan to do a 100 yard sight in in the next couple of weeks.
eastern people are smaller
was made in china
get a voltor AR adjustable
and throw whatever you want on it for a stock
It has a scope which I took off because it was too far aft for me to see through it and would have hit me in the eye on recoil.
ACE also makes an adaptor
side rail from midwest industries
ACE? adapter?
I have afew
No idea what you are talking about
lol right
@madmarine4212 so who is ACE and what sort of adapter for what?
hold on, I'll post afew
BTW I doubt I will ever have an AR.  Tried to get a full 80% ar kit the end of last year, but could not find a place whereI could walk in and pay cash, so I think it will be AK for me.
find your model of AK
then any AR stock will mount for Mil spec or Civ
So I can put this adapter on and then put an AR stock on it and not worry about the stock being too short?
Here I thought I was going to be making my own wooden stock.
just buy the right one for your model of AK
nope
this is it
no cutting or mods
I did pick up a receiver cover with a picatany rail on it and a low profile mount for a red/green dot along with a green dot.  My eyes are not so good with iron sites anymore.
Got it from opticsworld
theres so much variety, the rest is easy
Also have a laser bore site for it so I do not have to blow too much ammo getting zero .
yeah, youll get there quick, maybe 5 to 15 rounds
do the irons first
at 25m
then do your optics
be sound as pound brother
nailing 8 inch groups at 200 yards
head shots
So you think I should site in at 200 yards instead of 100?
25 meters brother
for both
So 25 meters will make me low at 100 no?
no, youll be alittle low at 200
but the ak is designed to shoot at belt buckles at that distance
your shots will hit neck to shoulder level
I always did my hunting 30-06 at 100 yards, but I guess combat firing is a bit different
the 762 climbs and falls rapid
shoots like a howitzer
yeah all comabt guns your good at 25
most spec ops guys zero at 50
weith 556
with 556
Being Navy I only touched a rifle once as a military thing.  That was when I qualified.  Interestingly enough in 1979 or 1980, not sure which, they had us do quals on the M1 Garand!
yeah they didnt teach you guys much
thats why you had marines and the master at arms
Range instructor was shocked when I did my rappid off hand.  nailed them all in the middle.  I said that is what comes from growing up a country boy shooting most days after school.
I never held a weapon until basic
Now that my home is in NYC I do not get to shoot except up at camp.
God I'm sorry
My bud Dennis is NYPD
With the shortage of ammo I hardly shoot.
Have him contact me.  Let's get him into the NYC chapter.
hes gonna medically retire soon from PD
I do not blame him
he wants out bad
its a shit show
hes just short of his 20ish, he doubles a door man on 5th
Folks say why not leave NYC, well aside from having some entanglements keeping me here I firmly believe we need to take back places like NY BOStON SF PORTLANE etc.
hes not hurting for cash
I am sadly hurting for cash.  Out of work for a long time.
yeah I wouldn't live in NYC for all the whis\key in Ireland
I sort of got stuck here for work after USN.
Got some property and that is now tied up in litigation, so can not sell or rent it.  What was going to be my retirement fund is in hazard and I am stuck.
you think its bad, my girl works in congress and is a democrat
at least shes mostly on our side
I say sell her!
nah,shes a huge gun advo
Actually my wife voted for Biden.  Now she regrets it.
shes sweet as pie, just hung up on race
The only race I care about is the Indy 500.
my whole team out here is brown, I'm part brown
but I bleed green
Used to watch the 24 hours of le mans and some of the road races at watkins glenn, but TV stopped showing most of them
ultimately red,white,blue
I love cars bro, I have a 55 chevy
a 65 mustang
a 66 chevelle
trying to get a 32 ford coupe as we speak
in the corps, we used to say your green
dark green
I would love to have a small car collection.
green, light green
Yep in the navy grey
we use the slurs amongst ourselves,wont use them here
The ak47 has a very distinct sound...you will learn tjis sound!!!
but we never got offended
I would really like an old willies military jeep.
I've held my brothers of every color in our worst moments
Simple to maintain and will go through most anything and can be portaged over a log by 4 20 somethings
even the gay guys, and there are plenty
I'm a bible guy, don't hide it
love my gay soldiers and marines too, most were good
they didnt hide their thing, didnt hide mine
most were really cool with it
I never served with anyone who I would say was not good.
yeah, I hear that
I did have one female sailor in my division who was STUPID
I think I'll start telling more war stories in  here
Ok6 cut me off on my sniper tales
Went to an off limits club.  Got in a fight.  Got her head cut.  Came back to the ship, woke the doc up for the head lac and told the doc how it happened!  Stupid!
but Rhodes is good
I had to represent her at captains mast
nothing but love for him
oh yeah bro
I've done two captains mast
walked out good from both
I could not say much for her other than she was in need of some education and I would provide it for her.  Think the old man took pitty on her and just docked her 2 weeks pay.
thats alright
just two weeks, no loss of rate
no extra duty
Got to run.....have a radio net at 1200 EDT
thats just a slap on the wrist
what radio do you run
?
music? politics?
Today it will be a mil set.  TW-100 5357 Khz USB
nice, ive done some guest hosting in the past
and been a guest for vet channels
mostly Jazz and rock guest hosting
hey woman
how are you?
Hi Mike! I'm doing fine, thanks. Preparing for a move to Florida. How about you?
hanging in
still got my number?
I had to get a new phone, lost your texts
ive got people in Florida
Yes, I still have it. Sorry you lost your phone. Thanks for thinking of me. I'll text you now, so we have the phone connection.
6239103999, call me please
real quick want to talk
I was not speaking broadcasting and one way radio.  Two way.  Comms.
Just had a short interchange with my attorney.  He thinks there is nothing wrong with Waters, or with folks chanting to burn down our cities.
He claims the same happened during the civil rights movement in the 1960s.  When I pointed out to him that I lived through that and that the leaders of the civil rights movement called for peace and tossed folks out that wanted violence he called me a racist!
Is there a way to do my membership dues without it being through the mail. Hell I'll even just shoot it to someone's paypal or just do a direct deposit. 
Tell your Attorney that I said he's a coward.
Can you talk now?
I got about 6 minutes. Let's do this
Point is here is an educated man buying in to this crap.
If you can't catch me by one I've got 15min around 1500 and I'm off at 1800
Wish i could fire him.  Sadly circumstances prevent that.
The educated are indoctrinated into buying into it. Look at the current situation of US Colleges and technical schools. 
I guess my mama and papa raised me to think for myself and to know what is right and what is wrong, but others did not have the benefit of a USN CPO father and Navy wife mother.
howdy SR! good to see you! praying for you brother!
Howdy TnMarine! took all i had to land in Texas!:laughing:
On April 15, Preident Biden signed an Executive Order on Blocking Property with Respect to Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation. Contrary to its title, this EO is not about Russia. It is designed to allow the Biden administration to deprive American citizens and organizations of their rights and property by arbitrarily linking those persons to real, imagined, or vaguely defined activities of the Russian government.
Giving legal representation, hosting the website, selling food, and giving medical care to a ‚ÄúDeprived Person‚Äù is automatically prohibited. Section 4 prohibits transactions that ‚Äúcause a violation‚Äù of this EO, even absent intent or knowledge. This serves as a hint to pre-emptively cut ties with anyone the Biden regime targets.
That‚Äôs right‚Äîit‚Äôs all good, no worries. 
:fire: WARNING From CMP For M1 Garands

"The CMP advises to not use .30/06 ammunition in M1 Garands, 1903s, and 1903A3s that is loaded beyond 50,000 CUP and has a bullet weight more than 172gr. These rifles are at least 70 years old and were not designed for max loads and super heavy bullets. Always wear hearing and eye protection when firing an M1 Garand, 1903 and/or 1903A3 rifle.

This warning is an update/addition to the Ammunition section in the Read This First manual enclosed with each rifle shipment (M1 Garand manual-page 6 and M1903 manual-page 10)."

I have an all-original M1 that I purchased at an Estate Sale from a very trusted source.  I completely stripped it down, including the iron sights - every nut, bolt, screw - and checked all tolerances.  Everything was near factory-new specifications. 

The only ammo that I shoot is M1 Garand:  For example - PRVI M1 GARAND 30-06 150GR FMJ

You're awesome!
There is a leadership call tonight to address issues etc
I haven't seen papaprim on the chat since we came back from deplat.

He's been in here but haven't seen him lately either
Well, am glad to hear there is a leadership call tonight. 

I hope SR gets around to DELEGATING some of the load he's carrying by himself.

Executive Order Canceling the Constitution
By Leo Goldstein

On April 15, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Blocking Property with Respect to Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation. Contrary to its title, this EO is not about Russia. It is designed to allow the Biden administration to deprive American citizens and organizations of their rights and property by arbitrarily linking those persons to real, imagined, or vaguely defined activities of the Russian government.

The Biden administration unilaterally makes the determination and requires neither criminal acts nor intent. The punishment is blocking assets and a prohibition on any dealing with the accused person. Spouses and adult children of individuals found guilty by accusation under this EO are punished, too.

The EO was preceded by some distracting maneuvers, both diplomatic (hostile rhetoric toward Russia) and military (sending naval ships toward the Black Sea and recalling them back, as if dealing with Russian threats). Thus, many people assumed that the EO was directed at Russia, and completely missed the fact that it is directed at dissent here, at home.
sorry this might have been covered above:woozy_face:
SR in chat now
Wow, cancelling the Constitution! Its interesting that he thinks he has that authority!!
China would be committing suicide if they launched. I thought Xia was smarter than that!
ok - i was told some stuff about a week back that is starting to line up... man i pray it goes 'the way' i was told!.. buckle up it might ((F'ING 5-STAR MEGA CRAZY)) for a bit... we might be going to the very edge... again (think 1963cuba BUT on steroids) >>> NOT supposed to end (bad):thinking:
windy if what they say about these vaccines is true our military will be devastated if not wiped out if/when these purported serious side effects take hold
...with no kinetics necessary, defeat by 'bio-weapon' injection
:sunglasses: happy Taco Tuesday everybody!:taco:
HEADS UP!  Chauvin verdict is in, and apparently judge will make it Public at 14:30 EST.  Please keep this channel clear of other chit chat.  Let‚Äôs stay focused.
WARNING: 

Anyone in a major city, where rioting is expected, get out.  Take a vacation.  Get off the X.  Do not fuck around.
Unless you are on a dedicated mission to defend others you are responsible for AND you have sufficient back up.
That warning being given, we are also honor bound to do what we can to help those who request our assistance.   And remember our commitment to backing the blue and to defending first responder families (‚Äúfamily safe‚Äù). 

Let your conscience and your honor be your guide in that, but also recognize that you will be both under a microscope and open to ‚Äúlawfare‚Äù by leftist prosecutors (potentially both in state and federal). 


Just know that this is likely to be far, far worse than in the past since the radical left now has a green light from federal officials (including the Imposter In Chief) and Democratic members of Congress.  They will feel they have political and legal cover to do as they please.
Also recognize that the likelihood of kinetic violence is now far greater because the radical left feels they have blanket political and legal support.  They will be emboldened. So DO NOT take it for granted that a mere presence will deter them. Be prepared in case you are attacked.  And do not count on backup or police response if you get into deep Kimchi.
#OperationSwampKitchenSink - we're good in my area (outside HOU-ENE) SR - put together a security team for our hood - only prob i have is wife has a business in the city - would NOT enjoy any 'extraction op' & she'll sream loud enough for you to hear up your way when i pull the plug on her commute!:grin:
Also be mindful that radical left HATES small town ‚Äúred zone‚Äù conservative America.   Keep in mind we may see intentional targeting of small towns or suburbs for civil unrest, arson, or even direct kinetic violence.  It CAN happen. 

Keep your head on a swivel regardless of where you live.
Greetings fellow Oath Keeper. This is a great idea, but 35,000 out of 18 million veterans is the tip of a spear still missing the shaft. I would love to revisit the Constitutional Insurrection you so eloquently and correctly advised Trump to utilize while in office. A Memorial Day National Call Out to all veterans and patriots to step up to the plate to honor that oath by responsible acceptance of their duty to deal with our domestic enemy....State,local, and federal government, would be a welcome sight....concerned citizens need a movement to join in and support to put a physical presence in the streets bent on stopping this ongoing madness...There ISN"T one...?
i'm too f-ing old to do security escort crap in war zones! limited to neighborhood watch - #KnowYourLimits
Now would be a good time to check your emergency comms, your emergency medical gear, and to check your six.  Be aware of who is coming and going in your AO and watch for suspicious activity.  Do not presume that the bad guys will all look a particular way.  Go off of behavior, not looks.
#ooorah - coverd SR
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=uMnALep6iPR3Zgxj4) Correct.  Know your limits is right.
10-4 SR
And you MUST have video of any altercation. Even if just your cell phone stuck in your shirt pocket to use as an improvised body cam.  You may need it to prove your innocence if you are involved in an incident.
however this is one (my) neighborhood watch you want to avoid! even 5.0 knows 'we got this street' - good to have LEO relationships right now too
...excellent point SR!
Verdict to be read between 1630-1700
Guilty on all 3 counts...polling jury now on verdicts
overturned on appeal
jury just trying to get out of the building alive?? NO doubt they were severely intimidated!!!
agree andyjack - this turd don't float!
went to bed thinkin... time to chop the mange & get with a battle-cut!.. got up (late of course) & did just that! stubbled the beard & the head! i'm so ugly now i could be a Marine!:rofl:
To all you current and former LEO's I express my apologies for the entire country. What you do every day is an honorable profession and worthy of our praise and gratitude.
speaking of andyjack - ya'll might consider joining the Constitutional Sheriff & Peace Officer Association Posse - don't have to be a LEO to be a 'Posse brother'! C.S.P.O.A. https://www.cspoa.org
I guarantee my sheriff is not a member. Same county as Seattle.
being a Posse member can be an ice breaker when approaching local LEO's too - you'd be surprised how many are members!
I live near a small town. The LEOs there were very grateful to anyone who would stand with them last year when this first started.
yeah i'm behind enemy lines here in Harris county-TX Dems have rigged their way into a blue lock on the electoral process - 11/3 we had 12 spots on the ballet that dems ran unopposed - waste of time & $$ for a repub to run
BUT we're building a grassroots army from the ground up & we will NOT be stopped!
The republicans here are all rinos anyway. Not much difference between them and dumbacrats
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=uDi6D23SeAHnTqCTD) :star2: CSPOA - Been a Major Life Member For Years.  Sheriff Mack Was My Guest Speaker In Llano, Texas in February 2013.

There was a CSPOA Seminar in The Woodlands on February 26/27.  Spoke with Burnet County Sheriff Boyd and Chief Cummings about attending.  First, I had secured $600 in pledges to cover registration and expenses.  He returned a Constitutional Sheriff and attended the Burnet County Commissioners Meeting the following Tuesday.  With his support we got a 100% vote to make Burnet County a Sanctuary County.

You will be amazed at how many Constitutional Sheriffs are just waiting for the constituents to approach them with support.  It really helps if you have already secured the funds, since it delivers a very positive message of what We The People want.

Here is a flyer that I created to assist in recruitment.  It has all the pertinent information in one place that can be emailed or printed.

This a seriously wrong. Ttump was getting sued by the libterds at every turn. Where are the conservative Lawsuits to stop this abomination?

On behalf of Hillsborough County I would like to congratulate you on moving from a pretty state ran by assholes to a slightly less pretty state that's still pretty ran by awesome people and that I hope to be passing you on the highway soon if not bumping into you randomly!!!

If you need help finding work and you don't mind the drive to Lake Wales or working for a MMJ company hit me up. I would love to have another Oath Keeper working alongside me! 
His coming will be like a thief in the night.  Beware the false prophets.  No man can predict his coming, but the faithful must be watchful of the signs.  The only thing Revelations states about using analysis to predict anything is deciphering the name of the beast by his number: 666.
Stew's a good guy. You too!
This is essentially the same as Trump's EO 13848
I ran 11 datacenters, 4,000 servers, and 61 technical personnel
our server OS's were CentOS (linux variant) and Windows 2012/2016/2019
we also had ~1,000 w10 and mac OS end user devices and 800 cell phones using mobileiron MDM
You mean like in 2016 when conservatives owned house, senate and president and did jack shit.  Time to realize conservatives do nothing.
and a cisco call manager cluster for landline phones in the offices
slack instant messenger is what we used (would not recommend here) and I have experience with O365, AWS, premise-systems, databases and wireless
infosec & firewall work is my specialty, along with vulnerability assessment, patching & remediation
sorry i'm not getting notifications from this
so "unix engineer", no. "understand networking", yes. master class. "program", depends on what you mean. I'm not a software engineer but I can use tooling to create automation to do things.
Are you kidding? Biden loves China
FN9, are you up for exchanging phone numbers in this DM between you and I?  Do you prefer a more secure route? Am trying to exchange phone numbers with OKers before we get deplatted again.
Sure  mine is 714 654 5570  My name is Kait
Kait. Is that a girl's name?

My name is Ken, 480-628-6186. I'm a boy.  :laughing:
Oh I realize it alright. This is and has been a one sided fight.
yep  I'm a girl but also a warrior
Mike, my name is Ken. 480-628-6186. 

Thanks for you phone. We could get deplatted again without notice.
i follow Bo Polny closely! Dude 'knows' stuff! The Father likes him too! (thats always a plus!) i might add that what will occur... will be 'Biblical'!!!
on the line between Houston city limits & Sheldon Texas, bout 25 miles ENE of downtown
smack dab in the middle of the 'nuclear fallout path' if the city were ever to suffer a strike!:worried:
Everyone knows that he loves China. But if you think just because he and his family are making boat loads of money from China by selling out American interests, that is somehow going to stop China from advancing their power grab on a global scale, well what can I say.
safe to say, buydens 'intent' on the EO is different than Trump's was
Or in a simpler way, what does his love of China have anything to do with their military advancements in the China sea or around the world? I really don't get where you're coming from with your comment?
Were you on the National call a few min ago?
are you on signal?
About half way between Waco and Palestine in Teague. In the middle of nowhere.  
Saying China would be committing suicide.  I disagree because Biden will not do jack against them.
This just in. 
Ukrainian just named the Biden family in  corruption and money laundering. 
Can anyone speak to this or verify. Seems legit. 
The implied intent is exactly the same as Trumps except that where Trump linked the actions of the order to any foreign government, Biteme's actions are linked solely to Russia and there are no (45+45 day process) timelines in this order. We know with Trump nothing ever came with his EO. Time will tell what may or may not come with the corpse's EO.
I don't follow links to links... is it the same subject matter as this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0w3r6P_hmE There are also other transcribed Ukrainian press conferences and interviews which I once-up-a-time had posted on Parler (we know where those went) which I tried but couldn't find the links to. To answer your question, it seems legit.
A buddy sent it to me so sorry bout the link to link. Thanks for giving it some validity though. 
Does anyone feel that this will go anywhere?
Personally I don‚Äôt just seeing the direction everything else has gone. 
If you're interested in that history and what came from it, Beck is anal and does a pretty good breezing over the quid pro quo and it morphing into the first Trump impeachment. https://youtu.be/dCSwqca8KXU?t=798
"This" what? Biden corruption going anywhere? Not as long as he controls DoJ.
G'night Brethren!.. stay frosty!:thumbsup: :relaxed:
No, I wasn't on the call. I was hoping you'd be on the call and then tell me what happened.  Anything happen?  I gotta get Signal.

BTW, I know plenty of fierce women warriors. Not ones to be trifled with or underestimated. 

What part of the Valley are you in?
The call was aborted due to tech issues,, rescheduled for tomorrow evening.  You just download app from itunes or playstore.  Sometime I'll tell you about my background.  I live in Cochise County.  I fled Tempe over 3 yrs ago.  I love it here in red rural Cochise County
Tombstone area? Goodness. You're out there.  That's pioneer country!

I could download Signal ahead of tomorrow's OKer meeting, but I don't think National has vetted me yet. It'd take five minutes to vet me. I'm not hard to find on the internet.

Let me know what happens. Wondering the fate of OKers in AZ.
@nomad1776 @bravo-echo That's actually a great question that begs further exploration! A brief review of recent history forces one to conclude that if any news story (favoring conservatives, at least) has the word "bombshell" in it, its a sure sign its not going anywhere. For example, remember all the "bombshell" reports we've heard over the last few years about things like how the Deep State was about to be exposed, Hillary and Obama about to be arrested (Durham investigation), military tribunals for Biden, Trump to be sworn in as the 13th president of the Republic on March 4th, etc. They all had one thing in common: They were all lies propagated by the lamestream press as "BOMBSHELLS" Am I wrong? 

We Americans need to wake up to the true extent to which we fall for these media hoaxes. They only serve as a tabloid-style "smoke and mirrors" technique, somehow putting the public's minds into a type of waking trance which allows our *real* enemies (i.e. Federal Reserve, CFR, IMF, World Economic Forum, Gates Foundation, Big Tech, Big Media, Big Pharma, the Rockerfellers and George Soros to continue to grow in power and destroy our country. Note that we rarely see any "bombshells" about them (the only notable exception being the Snowden revelations, which had surprisingly little impact on our national consciousness!). I fell for it too, for the longest time. But no more. I wouldn't trust any of these media "bombshells" they periodically toss at us like a dog bone, promising of the next miracle revelation. I would even go so far as to say that countering this strategy, i.e. figuring out how to get the people to reactivate their critical-thinking abilities (or activate them for the first time!) constitutes our most pressing strategic challenge in this war.

The globalist Marxists have been stunningly successful with this approach. It literally allows them to create a virtual reality in real time, swaying millions to obey a blind herd mentality of irrational, self-destructive behavior. Another takeaway here, is that, sadly, it will inevitably be the super-rich who are able to find new ways like this, to fleece and control the masses. (see Matthew 25:29). That is, it will be that way, until there are enough of us who catch on to their games, and muster the resolve to unite and wrest back our freedom from them (historically requiring physical force). Just as our training teaches us to maintain situational awareness at all time, likewise, we constantly need to keep asking ourselves: "What treacherous actions by our enemies might these latest "bombshell" reports--being constantly spread like viruses around the Net--be trying to mask and distract us from? (No puns intended).

For us to have a chance of topping the New World Order at its own game, we must now return fire by questioning anything that only serves only to confuse, rather than clarify. Perhaps its even time for us to question this whole notion of "reality" itself? This is most certainly consistent with the type of unconditional warfare that will be critical to our victory.
1984isNow, Brother that was not my comment, that was windy's. I think the key to making these "Threads" work is putting the individual your comment is aimed towards at the front of your comment. I was guilty of doing the same thing in my responses to you here. I will be mindful to correct that in the the future. I am on your side of the argument.
Good morning you Patriots and in windy's case, "novelists", lol. 
Girl you shore can write.
Good morning all OK brothers and sisters! I second that about windy!
What‚Äôs up mass brother?
Good morning to you brother DaveyE7.
Played around with that Icom yet?
Me just barely. I learned a crucial lesson here when responding in or to a thread. wndy made a comment yesterday at 3:53 pm that, "China would be committing suicide". I responded that "they were just posturing". 1984isNow fired back without putting "windy" at the beginning of his response and he and I were on a roll like two alpha dogs. Lesson learned, put the person you are responding to at the front of your volley.
It is funny looking back at it.
What time was it at?
Click on threads. 3:53pm
Ok just saw that while fighting morning traffic 
Be careful 
You're out the door early. 
Good morning brother WKNC 
Lol it was funny you two where saying the same thing while fighting over the bone
Yes on my way to libtard central for NC this morning up near Raleigh
That was cool we all had input into SR‚Äôs interview yesterday 
He asked which was cool
I hit reply to her comment.  Not sure what your issue is.
Yes it was. If anything useful came out of that shit storm from, those OKs going on "60 minutiae" it was getting SR back on the chat.
He needed to but he is neck deep in bs
I hope he handled that with them
 Need to keep them in the fold
I'm sure he did. But they broke the chain of command "bad"!
Yes my foot would have been so far up someone‚Äôs ass!
Amen to that brother. 
What you have planned for today?
Back on fence duty. I built a new front yard fence last year out of Brazilian walnut. I should have my head examined, oh wait, I have, and I am officially crazy! 
Moss, also in Charleston and looking to organize.....
Lol aren‚Äôt we all?
Finishing it up is going to take me a month. 
It's the third hardest wood on the scale 
Well good luck with that
Ouch makes it more difficult?
Every screw has to be pre-drilled in steps and the wood gums up the drill bits.
That‚Äôs a lot to deal with
On top of that I had to pick the craziest lock latches. I am a glutton for punishment! 
I needed that laugh 
You should get a speach to text and text reader system in your car so you don't crash!
I have way too much practice at this. Besides I don‚Äôt want to interrupt my music
Gotta have music
Plus I am working 2 phones at times
Yes today Disturbed
Great! üò≥
Helps tune out the bs
Traffic is one thing about work I don't miss!
Yeah it will be bad up here today always is! Dumb ass libs 
Them and their stupid Prius‚Äôs
They are
For sure
I give them a roll of coal from my souped up diesel. Do the same to the save the planet idiots on the sidewalk with signs. Hit the throttle hard and black soot all over them!
Lol excellent!
Love it
It makes me smile 
I‚Äôll bet
What pisses me off is they drive this stupid cars good for the environment like they are in NASCAR 
They never stop to think where the electricity that charges their cars comes from
Yes you correct
It‚Äôs not all wind and solar idiots

1984isNow, Rob I have no issue with you. But my brother if you don't see how a reply in a thread without putting the name of that person you are directing it towards at the start can be mistakenly taken as being directed at another individual who replied in the thread prior to you, then carry on. Me personally, I learned from this interaction with you. We were going at each other like two alpha dogs. I for one will make sure I start my comments (when directed to an individual's statement) with their name.

Day 170, since the successful communist election coup of America.

Good morning Christian patriots upholding the principles and rights this country was founded on, any way necessary.  From Sweet Home Alabama! God bless the USA!
I think Putin is expected to make an important speech and announcement today.
No he didn't have a fair trial at all. Doing their job and trying to stay alive and within the law of restraining a thug wired up on dope is darn near impossible, Unintentional death for sure. he was screwed before it started.
America has never been in the position of being taken advantage of by other countries as we are now because of the people let into this country who want to break it down and rebuild it to be their country and the stealing and cheating by blacks in election locations, major money from bigtime tech companies and weak and scared supreme court judges. Like a drug test if you ain't dirty you do not mind showing your hand but when you are you try like heck for it to not be known just like they are trying to stop the theft and flipping and stealing of votes from being found and counted, they know their busted it just takes time. But we have the numbers, the 2nd amendments rights and ammo to defend the constitution as designed which no law is above. There is a reason the 2nd. amendment came second to make sure no one will ever own our butts again. It ain't happening.

Hi Gman. Is the training on the westside?
:face_with_monocle:  *Do You Agree or Disagree - The Second Amendment Is Moot?*

The U.S. Constitution - including The Bill of Rights - does not convey, give, grant, nor transfer any of our Natural Rights.  As expressed in The Declaration of Independence - a template for the future U.S. Constitution - "...We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are *endowed by their Creator* with certain unalienable Rights, *that among these* are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness..." (Note that not all of our Rights are expressed - only the paramount ones - upon which others are based.)  Our Natural Rights existed throughout Man's History, before there was any form of government.

Among The Founders there were contentious arguments as to whether or not The Constitution acknowledged and protected our Rights.  In order to get some of the hold-out Colonies to Ratify The Constitution, The Bill of Rights was added, based upon sources such as _The Virginia Declaration of Rights_.  It was intentionally written in plain-and-simple language to ensure that there could be no misunderstanding nor misinterpretation. Also, to ensure that virtually all of the Colonists understood what was being established and ratified, several of The Founders wrote for publication in newspapers what is the collection of The Federalist Papers.  Basically, The Founders gave us INSURANCE POLICIES (aka The Bill of Rights) to protect our Rights.

So, to all the Commies in WaShitOn D.C. :poop: , with or without The Bill of Rights, the Right still exists.  Take away any insurance policy and the underlying asset still exists.  Remove The Second Amendment and *THE RIGHT STILL EXISTS!* :rage: 

It is NOT a Second Amendment Right...It is  Second Amendment PROTECTED Right.  That word PROTECTED is virtually always left out.

Agree or Disagree? :thinking:

Nope no stick. Plus that is a strictly "exit only" area!

Hey you can be real with me. If you think he had a point, sometimes it hard to tell from our own view of things?
Gold and silver. If you can't hold it, you don't own it. Take physical delivery of precious metals.
If you don't own any gold or silver bullion, start by purchasing "junk" silver US dimes and quarters.  Very affordable and very useful.

No I don‚Äôt know what was eating him but your responses were fine. I hate to say it but could he be a troll? Comments are very troll-like from other comments I have seen on other sites or articles 
Could be. I went on our main chat to pull up his info and all it had was his name. No military or LEO info.
Ok then it‚Äôs not just me. I wasn‚Äôt on the old chats enough to know if he was there
I'm too new to know the answer to that. But you know on our official chat page, (not the app version) you can look up what ever a member sets as public about their profile.
Great catch @lonestarhog Shocking development there, but are we really surprised. Let's take our country back.
Yes so that‚Äôs all he has?
Yes just Rob Miller I believe? 
That's why I added his first name to try and calm thing, make it more personable? 
I don‚Äôt want to start trouble but I also don‚Äôt want a troll in our midst. Maybe ask jpj about him in a dm and ask if he has been vetted
I thought you did fine. His reaction was odd

Hello from the mountains of western north North Carolina
Very well put sir,...im gonna use some of that if i may....
LeBron James can get f**ked. I'm tired these overpaid assholes getting away with such threats.
Greetings. And, again, thanks for the kind words, the support, and encouragement. I have spoken, in great length, with a county sheriff. CSPOA and Oath Keeper member. The lack of will, the lack of patriots, nor the Constitutional authority and provisions not being there, none of these are a problem. Putting together large numbers of concerned citizens to stop all government in its tracks is the sole solution. All answers and remedies stem from one single act. Life will go on. People will step up to the plate. The geopolitical landscape will change, in that instant, and will not only remain standing, but will bear witness to a great awakening and revival. Why......because, that is what would have to happen.....so I look to things that might draw such numbers to create this certain response, without reservations of any kind, without pause. I'll keep you posted....
Agree. Conversely, if we allow that which is clearly not authorized in the Constitution,, it will be viewed as law, and count as such. A firm hand on the reins was thought to be a given. We the People dropped the ball...and better pick it back up!
Keeping.AZ   I know the cheating was done by blacks and whites, no doubt about it. The cities where most of the cheating was done was in majority black cities with black mayors who did nothing to stop it but a lot to advance it.
Keeping.AZ Your right the stealing and cheating was top to bottom and a lot was funded by two white big tech billionaires and Soros, crooked Clinton and many others.  It is all coming out just takes time. I'm not blaming blacks only I'm saying the cities where it was stolen mostly was mostly black ran and black populated cities. The cheating and stealing was decided to take place in cities where it would be most accepted and desired by the residents. It wasn't planned to take place in a 90210 zip code.
How do you mean? Usually when you are using a highly directional antenna like that, you have it on a rotor that you can control remotely. A waterfall is just a way to visualize the bandwidth you are receiving.
Someone please add windy to your signal chat
I  the regional coordinator I can get you connected
Good morning all be alert and aware as always brothers and sisters!
Hey asshat lebron where is your ‚Äúaccountability‚Äù by posting this bs? Crickets.....that‚Äôs what I thought. The Officer stopped an attack! What a moron....
Morning brother
Good morning to you the patriots, the Keepers of the Oath.
My mentioning the waterfall was only as a method of identifying signal traffic but obviously unhelpful in locating directionality. It probably just confused my question. I fully understand that directional antennas are rotor controlled when tower mounted. My question is this; is a radio direction finder something you should add to the necessary pieces of equipment when installing a directional antenna, like a rotor head and controller? 
Morning to you.
not normally no. RDF for HF would take quite a bit of spacing, and fairly large antennas. The way the signal bounces makes this unreliable as well. For UHF/VHF, it could be helpful, but again, RDF is usually best when mobile, or if you have multiple sites and can then triangulate.
if its something you are interested in, you might want to look into this: https://www.crowdsupply.com/krakenrf/krakensdr
This is the new SDR from the guys who made the Kerbos SDR
software is already written and runs on a smartphone
I got tired up trying to reword a question  to a HAM.
Oh ok and? Get it right and answered?
That thing looks awesome. I stumbled on it last night on YouTube after asking my question, but I wasn't actually sure if it was useful for HF signal location or if it was ment for higher frequencies only.
Are they expensive? 
He's already back to me. I think I have a habit of complicating a questio!
Lol what were you asking him?
Regarding directional antennas, Yagi, log-periodic and Hexbeam, are radio direction finders the best method of locating radio traffic or are there newer better methods? 
He sent me this.
https://www.crowdsupply.com/krakenrf/krakensdr
Interesting. Something you want for your truck?
I can see some uses for that
Maybe, the Hexbeam is the hottest thing in lower frequency 160m-6m antennas. They are about 40' across though. But I have an idea on modifying the antenna so the arms collapse telescopicly and fold up. Added to my 21' pneumatic mast with a rotor and you would have a strong system.
Makes sense. How much ?
The antenna self build kits are about $300. But modifying it would cost. I am still trying to find a price for this direction finder the OKr sent me. Looks like it is very new technology. 
You mast will be mounted on the truck?
Or is?
I'm planning on mounting it.
That would make a strong system and mobile. You should mount that on your RV
That was my original reason for buying the mast. But lately I've been thinking of trading in the motor home for a trailer 
Travel trailer? Been thinking about investing in one also
Wouldn't wa t to make modifications to the motor home that would hinder a trade in
Just limited in size of what I can tow

Yes, I do have a 3500 Ram Cummins but I've been thinking of down sizing.

A light weight 23‚Äô travel trailer is the best I have seen 
My straight tow is 9800 but its setup for a fifth wheel which brings it way up
Yes true

But I want to downsize a lot

The boyfriend 
He hates BLM
Then he's a good one
He is
Sent him a link to the video on the OK site. Said he is gonna dig out his 214 and join
Don't need the 214. He can just take pic of his 100% ID, black out some of the data and send it in.
Good to know I will tell him
Yes makes it very easy 
The first time we went out to eat when they opened restaurants again down here was when the BLM idiots where going into places and ‚Äúprotesting‚Äù. I told him I wasn‚Äôt gonna stand for that if anyone got close to me and the family. He said I got your back just don‚Äôt shoot me accidentally 
One day someone is gonna make a strong stand
And it won‚Äôt be pretty

@rylandrebel   I absolutely agree with you, the Left is and has been targeting poor, black communities for decades. Plain as day. The Left's policies have not only weakened family, faith, and prosperity in those communities, but then the Left twists the double-edged sword as they yank it from the wound, fomenting through demagoguery victimhood, oppression, resentment, and anger. The Left is cleverly exploiting human weakness and racial tensions within our melting pot society to divide and tear down the system to advance their Marxist agenda.  

THEY WILL FAIL, SO HELP US GOD.
Good morning Patriots!

Your correct, they keep black's mad so they are thinking about what they are mad about instead of thinking wait I'm being used, their controlling my mind for their own gain. been doing it since the welfare act came into play. Once they start giving blacks money to ruin them and once blacks start getting money to have babies so they don't have to work it's darn hard for them to want or have any desire to get up and go to work when they can go to the mail box and get money along with everything else. If they would only learn to believe what democrats do to them not what they tell them blacks would do a 360 in a heartbeat. But they are so use to blaming the white man on the democratic's word instead of stopping and sitting down and seeing they have been ruined by the democratic politicians.
never go by one's word  go by one's actions  very very simple
:salad: Keeping_AZ, the Left has always been bitterly opposed to "The Melting Pot", and, instead, view We The People as a huge tossed-salad where all parts are identifiable and can be segregated and removed at their discretion.

It's HARD for us humans to refuse "free" money and choose instead to work a job or take the risk of starting one's own business. Refusing free money runs contrary to our self-centered and sinful nature.  We long for security and the path of least resistance.  Unfortunately, the long term effect of accepting free money comes at an enormous price personally, spiritually, and for society.  It takes a great deal of courage to trust God and serve others; the long term effect however is priceless.

It seems that the KrakenSDR is not out for sale yet but coming soon. Hopefully it's not too expensive. In the meantime I'm looking at less expensive antenna options. Just started reading up on capacitance hats for vertical and screwdriver antennas. If built correctly they add a good amount of benefit to an antenna. Just have to account for the added wind load. Used on mobile rigs also. The hat makes up for shorter antenna lengths.
Keeping.AZ:   It isn't free when you will be beholding to the people giving it to you. Nothing is free but a hard time. Anyone accepting money without rendering a service should know there is a price to pay. Almost no one does something for nothing.
Not to bad. Just trying not to lose my mind over all the bullshit.

So, the illegitimate government empowered by a stolen election has now moved forward with a new state: Washington, Douglass Commonwealth. 2 Senators, 1 House member. Off to the Senate. Does this runaway train on its path of destruction look like it deserves OUR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION yet.....?
Washington, Douglass Commonwealth....? Passed the House again, heading to a different Senate this time. Or should I say INDIFFERENT Senate....because this rogue and illegitimate government has a mind and agenda of its own making. Are we ready to do it ourselves, as you stated. Will will call out publicly the 18 million veterans who took that oath against enemies foreign AND DOMESTIC, like you and I, and ready ourselves to address D.C. head on and face to face.....? Or do we continue looking under our feet as if we're maintaining a much saner position on what appears to be, for the most part, IMAGINARY HIGHER GROUND.....? The highest law of the land, the county sheriffs, have their heads so far up the federal governments ass it isn't funny....does being a concerned citizen mean ANYTHING in this country any more.....or do we remain seated, with the leadership, patiently hiding from responsibility....?
Anyone here a current or former member of USPISS?
I'm trying to remember if the Founding Fathers took the time to personally interview each and every colonist in America in the hope of receiving well wishes if not outright permission to overthrow the tyrannical English government....?

Statehood for Washington, DC. 
This is a perennial favorite of the Left. Been going on for decades. However, today the nation is quickly unraveling as the Left presses their advantage.

Does admitting a new state require a Constitutional amendment? Can this be accomplished by Congress alone? Legal scholars disagree.  Seriously, do you really think the Left gives a damn?

Excerpt from article in link below:
_"The Framers of the Constitution believed that the federal government needed to have control over the seat of government‚Äîover the place where it was to conduct its business‚Äîso that it would not find itself beholden to a particular state government for its day-to-day needs...." _ 

https://www.heritage.org/political-process/report/dc-statehood-not-without-constitutional-amendment
If this rogue government continues to hold sway over the conversation and political discourse via the media, and the citizens continue to sit idly by with their thumbs up their ass, we'll be seeing this come to fruition....seems like being Constitutional is an afterthought, if a consideration at all...

Honestly I love my Chameleon Antenna MPAS kit. They now have the 2.0 version. If you want a do all HF antenna, that's it.
End fed is a great option for something cheaper but still very flexable
If you just want a base station antenna, look at a wire dipole. I like my G5RV max, it lasted for years just hung from the trees, it got damaged this winter after it fell, and accidentally got run over by the snowblower
Screwdriver verticals are great for multi band vehicle mounted weapons
Setups, not weapons, dunno where that came from

DC statehood is unconstitutional on its face. New York City was the Republic's first Capitol, but later moved to the District of Columbia (donated by the state of Maryland) specifically established to be a neutral, non-partisan  territory for the nation's Capitol. By agreement, DC were allotted--as is appropriate--one Congressional representative, but no senators. Declaring DC a state (although not expressly forbidden by the Constitution, that I'm aware) is in direct opposition to it raison d'etre! If that were to happen, then a new Capitol would have to be established to perform the function for which DC was created. My I suggest Nome, Alaska!
How much crazier do you think it will get @gre81 ?

Nothing surprises me anymore. I expect it now
Good morning OathKeeprs
Ohh and good morning!
Those are some great antenna suggestions. I just pulled the trigger on the Icom IC-7100 for the truck. It's an all bander with dual antenna ports. So I'll be looking to cover the majority of the HF on one port and all of the VHF/UHF on the other. I have a 21' pneumatic mast that I've been thinking about mounting in the truck to help reach out when I'm parked. 
I picked up a good old Kenwood TS-2000 for the base. But my house is nearly at sea level behind hills to the south. I may just go with a fan dipole for now. Not sure that a tower is in my future here.

How is this interview different than recent interviews? SR confides the window of opportunity for patriots to turn the tide is not indefinite. Continue to stand down for now and allow the Left to fully unmask themselves to the general American public.  In effect, allow the Left enough rope to tie their own noose while unsuspecting American's come to realize the truth.

My thoughts. I agree. However, this is a very dangerous game. If patriots wait too long, we overshoot the mark with disastrous consequences. If we act too soon, we risk losing support from Americans who might otherwise have rallied to the cause.

Hog :cowboy: 

*I No Longer Recognize Minneapolis.  I No Longer Want To Live Here.*

April 22 (King World News) ‚Äì Grace Bureau:  MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. ‚Äî Minneapolis is my home. My happiest memories are here. It‚Äôs where I learned to ride a bike, had my first date, received my high school diploma.

But today, I‚Äôm too afraid to even walk in my neighborhood by myself.

The ACE Hardware down the street? The one that I used to bike to in the summer? Robbed twice in the past five days.

The Walgreens next to my elementary school? Molotov cocktail thrown into it.

The Lake Harriet Bandshell, where we spent countless Mother‚Äôs Days? Homeless encampment popped up next door.

These are the things you don‚Äôt read about in the news.

Ten minutes from my house, at 38th and Chicago, there is still an autonomous zone. Police are not allowed to enter. Residents have died because medical authorities couldn‚Äôt get through, and carjackers (of which there are MANY) will speed into the zone to escape officer pursuit.

My favorite dinner theater canceled its production of Cinderella because it was ‚Äútoo white.‚Äù

My church ‚Äî my beloved, tiny, Lutheran church ‚Äî organized social justice marches for our congregation while refusing to reinstate in-person services (they‚Äôre still virtual, by the way).

And how about the week of the 2020 riots?

We lived under a curfew for days while looters seemingly roamed freely. Friends fled their home at 3:30 a.m. because the auto parts store behind them was on fire. And then we watched in horror as our City Council members demanded that the city defund the police ‚Äî as they hired armed security for themselves.

I no longer recognize Minneapolis. I no longer want to live here. We are done, and I am leaving.

I‚Äôve spent the past year watching this city crumble. Burning it wasn‚Äôt enough, I guess. Every day, I watched another piece of sanity and stability fall to the hysterical, bloodthirsty, self-righteous mob.

You distinguish between rioters and protestors? Racist. You do not want Marxist-inspired racial justice theories to be promoted in schools? Racist. You thought that maybe ‚ÄúJustice for George Floyd‚Äù should be left to the courts, and not mob rule? Super, super racist.

And where were our leaders providing stability and calm and confidence in the system? Nowhere to be found. What we did find were crazed politicians spouting fire and brimstone (I‚Äôm looking at you, Maxine Waters and John Thompson) and leaving us to pay the price.

Let me be clear: this city‚Äôs demise wasn‚Äôt just violent protests and burning buildings, or crime skyrocketing and businesses fleeing. It was also political indoctrination, hypocritical leadership, and the suppression of oppositional thought.

Any condemnation of the violence was denounced as ‚Äúracist.‚Äù Billboards stating simply ‚ÄúSupport MN Police‚Äù were brutally vandalized. Schools supported BLM walkouts for their students, then shut down in-person classes for fear of violent riots.

And all of this happened against the backdrop of our illogical, inconsistent, overly oppressive COVID-19 restrictions.

It‚Äôs easy to look at (for lack of a better word) disaster zones like these and mentally distance yourself from them. Yeah, that‚Äôs awful, but those people choose to live there. They‚Äôre the ones electing these leaders. This is their problem.

Yeah, it is. It is our problem.

And I can‚Äôt help but look around and wonder, ‚ÄúWhat happened here? Where exactly did it all go wrong?‚Äù

Was it the liberal mob? Identity politics? The cries of ‚ÄúRACIST!‚Äù when someone disagreed with a particular reaction or policy?

Was it conservative silence as the loudest voices got more and more radical?

Was it our acceptance that ‚Äúwe live in a blue area, this is just the way things are?‚Äù

How did it all happen so fast?

Whatever it was, I‚Äôm leaving this dark, surreal, twisted version of Minneapolis on Friday. And I pray to God that I never have to come back.

This generation kills me! 
A police chief here in MA is in the shit for a "twit" he wrote saying something to the effect "that if George Floyd¬†behaved like Chauvin did after being found guilty, turning and presenting his hands behind his back to be cuffed, that we would be in a much different place right now". I complained to my 30 year old stepson sitting across from me that I can't believe he is catching heat for that factual statement. My stepson, who lives in NYC and obviously brainwashed by the MSM got all heated saying that Floyd didn't resist! I realized it wasn't worth explaining to him that the coverage he's seen is extremely slanted and that there is plenty of footage of Floyd resisting online where you can find fact not MSM fiction. 
Not that it at all justifies what Chauvin did.
Sorry for going on but this PC shit gets my blood boiling.

Dealing with life and computer issues. You know I wonder how many folks realize that they are being conditioned to be slaves? Most folks don't really think about it. This whole BS pandemic that is a very medium version of the flu bug (they are the same family) is allowing governments globally to push agendas that should have folks looking for rope. Only fear and wanting to be in the included group over the excluded groups, since governments are ordering the stazi section of police forces to round up and beat those who point out the outright lies on this whole BS. This is not going to end well either way. One is the fall of individual human rights on a global scale not just the US and the other is a purge of the corrupt starting in the US and slowly going global. There is no middle ground, I wish there was but that day has long gone by.

Positioning and posturing continue on the Russia-Ukraine border, edging us ever closer to all-out war between the Deep State Marxists and Russia (and likely the ChiComms too). Our enemies are going balls-to-the-wall with their fear/propaganda/psyops campaign and "vaccine" genocide program, trying to demoralize us and wear us down on all fronts. Don't let it happen. We must rise to the occasion and keep each other (few of us as there may be!) as uplifted and prepared as possible through this onslaught. From my perspective, the despair and apathy in our nation is palpable and worse than ever. Time is quickly running out for corrective action.

Barking Hello 
Hey Greg where is this training? would like to get into some training but it is to short of notice for me at this time but perhaps if I new of the next time I could make some plans to do that.. would be great. Let me know, when, where and what to bring. And where are you ? I‚Äôm in Buckley.
(Copy and pasted from a friend, but so worth the share.)Can you tell me if this sounds abusive? üòî
My friend's husband won‚Äôt let her visit any friends or family. He has made her stop all contact with them unless it‚Äôs on the phone or computer. He reads and censors her comments on social media. 
He makes her feel like she's going crazy for thinking he‚Äôs controlling, and that she is being ungrateful. (After all, he‚Äôs only doing this because of how much he cares about her.)
He doesn‚Äôt want her going to the gym anymore, so she doesn‚Äôt go. He also doesn‚Äôt let her go to work anymore (he told her to only rely on him for income and that he will take care of her).
She's not really allowed to go out anymore, unless it‚Äôs for necessities, and when she does, he makes sure to have people guilt trip her about it and shame her for it. 
He wants her to have this medical procedure done and tells her that if she does it, he will allow her more freedoms. 
He constantly says he's only doing all of this because he cares... he is just doing it for her own good. 
Oh wait....did I say husband? 
I meant THE GOVERNMENT 
My bad. 
You have been conditioned to be outraged if another person did this to their spouse, but be passive & compliant when it comes to our government. 
Please wake up!üòî

#FreedomMatters
FN9..."borrowed" (actually, STOLEN)!
I'm so busted!  but you're right**
No, FN9, I meant that *I* was 'borrowing'(stealing) it!
Ohhhh....LOL.....then we're both busted but you go right ahead!  It's meant for 'sharing'
Shared! You're right @FN9 This is exactly the exact same type of abuse the government is heaping on us, more and more every day. And just like an abused spouse--caught in the cycle of abuse--its not only not going to stop. Its going to get worse until We the People (i.e. you and I and our brothers and sister here put an end to it). There is no other. If we do not take back our freedom now, future generations will curse us that we did not stand up, when we were called to do so. Its up to us.....
From my brother in Christ, Colorado patriot filmmaker. Larry Cappetto. As Larry says in his brief but powerful new video (link below) there is little more to say, for those who claim to value the sacrifice of our forefathers. It is truly up to us--yes you and me, and us only--to heed God's call--now--and turn the tide against evil. The stakes are far too high to deny our sacred responsibility in this situation. Make no mistake about it. God is watching our every move, as Prophecy is fulfilled daily. I pray that we will heed His message. We the People of these United States of America cannot allow the atrocities to continue any further....

Hey Marine, having scoped out some of the globe myself as a Marine, I fully understand we in this country haven't seen much of the worlds terrors. Ignorant of it or not, Americas money men are directly linked thus responsible for much of the rest of the worlds plight while we indulge ourselves. The reality is if this country collapses, it is the only thing keeping the world from plunging into darkness via world communist control and surveillance, if not massive depopulation to make that easier. I like to think its bad enough everywhere and we are the vessel to be used to bring remembrance and accountability. You might see things differently....

Very likely the trigger will come unexpected, a seemingly small incident from a faraway place.  The govt will come down hard. Things will escalate very fast---FASTER THAN WE AND OTHER PATRIOT GROUPS can organize.  The American public is armed, but the Leftist govt has the infrastructure, organization, command structure, communication, personnel, equipment, and money to mobilize and respond immediately.

Let's face it. OKers and other patriot groups will NOT be organized when the SHTF. Even if we all started coming together TODAY, we won't be ready in time to hold the line.

Constructed November 2012 - Had To Make Several Items Since The Company Did Not Manufacture All Accessories, At That TIme

1 - Rubbermaid Commercial 500-Pound Capacity Cart
1 - Goal Zero 1250 Yeti
4 - Power*Sonic PS121000 Battery
1 - Anderson Connector Chaining Cable - This I made to connect the Yeti to the Power*Sonic battery bank. (175 Amp SB Series
Anderson Multipole, 4-gauge High Strand Flexible Power Wire, 5Ft, Lug, Tinned Copper for 1/2" Stud)
2 - Goal Zero Extreme 350 Power Pack
1 - Extreme 350 Chaining Cable
1 - Goal Zero Extreme Universal Inverter
4 - Goal Zero Light-A-Life LED Light
8 - Goal Zero Boulder 30 Solar Panel
2 - Goal Zero Boulder 100 Solar Panel
2 - Goal Zero Boulder 30 Tripod
1 - Prodex Insulation - I used this for my Faraday Cage since I had some left over from an insulation
project (Double-Sided Aluminum - three layers top and bottom of cart)
I also have numerous other cables/connectors for usage in virtually any situation (110/220VAC, 12VDC, USB, Cigarette Lighter)
The Goal Zero company uses the Ritar RA12-100D -- I researched and found the Power*Sonic PS121000 to be an exact match.
The battery bank is composed of four batteries wired in parallel, with the positive and negative taken from opposite ends of the
bank. This ensures even usage and charging.
The Yeti plus the battery bank provides 1250 Watt (1500 Peak) with 500Ah.
The Extreme 350s with the 12VDC, 3-Watt LEDs, will provide hundreds of hours of lighting before recharging.
The system is kept on 120VAC for immediate usage. If a prolonged emergency, the nine SOLAR panels will provide 440 Watts,
which may be charging during system usage. It can also be charged with the proper cable from my truck. Several different
options available for charging.
The total weight on the 500-pound-rated cart is 500 pounds, with the battery bank at 280 pounds.

üëçGreat article KAZ!
Well, we supposedly have patriots capable of living off the grid. Having said that, then patriot would be an inaccurate depiction, totally a figment of ones  imagination. Patriots wouldn't run and hide allowing the certain destruction and loss of millions of lives, as if a battle of attrition is the sole and sensible course to take here. Patriot would be very near the last of descriptions I could think of to describe people willing to stand idly by to witness such calamity...

"Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak. If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. *If he is in superior strength, evade him.* If your opponent is temperamental, seek to irritate him." -- Sun Tzu, The Art of War

Sounds like Guerrilla Warfare (aka Irregular Warfare) to me.  Will the Commies be "superior in strength"?  Well, YEAH! (i.e. The Terminator opening scene)  

"Loss of millions of lives"?  Well, it depends on the weaponry used by the Commies; that which Patriots do not have.

The best that Patriots can do is attempt to neutralize (i.e. disarm) those weapons.  One must also ask:  "What weapons has the Deep State developed about which Patriots are ignorant?" The only defense is to observe from the shadows and attempt to construct a viable offense and/or defense.

"Run and hide"?  Yeah, live to fight another day, only with newly-gained experience, knowledge, and tactics.

:thinking: Real President Trump's United States Cyber Command?

Hog :cowboy:
I seriously doubt it, but we can always hope, right? Extremely troubling, among all the rest of it.
When Real President Trump left office he did not attend Da Sniffer's inauguration.  It was reported that he flew to Abilene, TX, Maryland, then to Florida, with another possible stop.  Cyber Command HQ is Maryland.  

He was extremely active on January 20th and a couple days after.

Hope is one of those funny 4-letter words.

Hog :cowboy:
Interesting to consider, Hog...Could possibly be a connection there. We can pray the operation is under the control of pro-Trump forces. But with Biden, look no further than the gates of hell. He and the rest of his globalist friends are aiming for the takeover of all institutions worldwide. This would be totally consistent with that objective.
We are seeing persecution against Christians on a scale we have never seen before in our country ‚úô
Well said Hog. Anyone who thinks for one second that we will succeed against an all out assault from a fully equipped government such as ours without escape, evade and gorilla assault tactics, is not in it to win it. Throwing yourself to the wolves is simply suicide.

1) Story was first published by (wait for it) Washington Post, followed-up on by AP and was quickly repeated by every news outlet and their brother on the Internet leading immediately into the deep digs and resulting conspiracy theories. 2) OMB got on DoD's case last June for dragging their heels for years on transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6. They have already made progress as of December. 3) The big "chunk" of addresses (4% of IPv4) is miniscule compared to the number of addresses available under IPv6 (340 x 10e36). 4) The company taking it over (whatever their origins) can do nothing more with it now that what they could have already done without it before. 5) The story was first published by (wait for it) the Washington Post. 6) Just my opinion. https://www.c4isrnet.com/it-networks/2020/12/01/disa-makes-progress-upgrading-to-new-internet-protocol/
This is beyond concerning! Hopefully, not another red-flag event to take our eye of the ball, but it could easily be part of a globalist cyber-attack plan, and demanding immediate explanation. I mean these people are out to enslave the entire world, and they can accomplish that if they manage to gain total control of the internet.
As usual, I'm concerned about all this cyber stuff. This definitely isn't my area of expertise, but I do know that no internet-based system is 100% secure. All are subject to hacking, constituting our greatest vulnerability. This may force the next evolution in comms and information storage, separate from the internet. I can't imagine what that would look like, but we need to be the ones to invent it. We also need to be more proactive in countering cyber-attacks against us, from whatever quarter. I maintain that each of us have a right to an active defense against attacks on our space in the "cloud," as much as to our more tangible forms of property.

Well here in Scotland the population is dealing with a hard left socialist government that is using the lockdowns to push through a ton of "laws" that violate the standing law of the UK. They even passed laws that bound them in ways that they did not think about. Election on the 6th of May and they are promising the younger generation all the electronic toys you can think of just to get them to vote for the progressive socialist groups. It will be interesting to see as the SNP is now fractured due to in fighting and criminal activity. Doesn't make it any better for folks but they might lose control of government. Will let you know more as I know more. Been a very stressful time period.
Wow they are really using this covid shit to push the socialists NWO! You can bet your ass that it's happening here. That's how the election was stolen. And the long list of EOs that this dipshit is pushing through. Now they're actually going for packing the SC to 13 and making DC a state.

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
I am still waiting for things to pick back up again around here. TBH I was hoping for more activities, meetups, training events, etc
:question: Pardon my ignorance, but does The Great State of Texas have a Texas Chapter and a Texas President?

https://oathkeepers.org/state-chapters/ < Note that there is supposedly a presence on - of all places - Facebook.  But clicking on the link takes you to Facebook with a Warning, and no Texas Chapter.  So, how old is this data?

In 2009/2010 I contacted the then Texas President, who would not respond, with a couple of questions.  Subsequently, I just moved forward and became a Life Member (#140).

Now it is 2021 and I have to ask if nothing has changed?  Texas is just sooooooo dead :coffin: .

:rage: A team of researchers, while doing a microscopic recording of the so-called vaccine,  discovered a LIVING organism IN the vaccine.  They were asking each other to look, and all basically said, "What the hell is that?"

Da vaccine has also been referred to as an operating system.  Let's assume that is true, and like any operating system it can be controlled by various inputs.

Scenario:  At some point - possibly using 5G - they begin to trigger the operating system to destroy its host.  Could it also be pre-programmed to have the host turn on those who have not been vaccinated?  So many evil possibilities.....

THEY are no longer hiding their goal for 2025, which is to reduce the US population to 100 million - yes, more than a 2/3 reduction.  POOF!  GONE!  I keep hearing the idiots talking about Trump 2024. If THEY succeed with their 2025 goal, WHO the hell will be voting in November 2024, and be available for the Inauguration in January 2025?

We are surrounded by masked and vaccinated IDIOTS!

Hey Brother, There are 70 million citizens who know this government with its deep state is corrupt. There are 18 million veterans alone. There is no way there isn't the brains or manpower to not only stop government in its tracks, but enough to reset the direction this nation is allowing itself and the rest of the world to go in. None of us have even tried.....

I agree, as stated in General.  However, I did post the caveat that it will not be clean and simple.

Hog :cowboy:
Agreed. Versus leaving people capable of using pandemics to control and/or eliminate the worlds peoples, I'll take difficult and messy all day long....
By the way, regarding your comment about prescient patriots stepping forward: I know I cannot and will not stand by without attempting to wrestle the controls from the evil and their legions of fools.....Stewart himself said as much, as have sheriffs in the CSPOA....we must, and can, if we only will, and do..... These are two of the more visible citizens militia, if you use that term loosely....
What I meant by "prescient Patriot" is a person who can foresee the future.  Only such a prescient person can definitively state what will happen; as all else is merely hope.  For years, and as stated in General, I have compared our coming struggle as the opening of The Terminator.  We have absolutely no knowledge of what stealth weapons the Deep State has developed - with our tax dollars - that can/will be used against us.  Yes, our highly-trained and experienced Veterans can neutralize virtually all known weapons, but that is not the concern.  Any rational person is concerned with the unknown.  But, that is the purpose of recon. 

Hog :cowboy:
I'm working with others on a plan to bring national attention to the idea of stopping our state, local, and federal governments in their tracks based solely on this stolen election. The judiciary supported this fiasco, they are worthless as well. Purchased politicians must go, they all benefited from this atrocity that in essence allows them to select themselves. There is no need to explore or argue other issues. This one alone can put the horse back in front of the cart......that horse being WE THE PEOPLE....
Stellar points all, Hog! To date, over 14,000 deaths already reported worldwide directly attributed to these covid "vaccines" (i.e. experimental, unauthorized genome-altering drug). That's more than the sum total of reported deaths from all the other vaccines combined, since they started the VAERS adverse reaction reporting system. Since VAERS is a voluntary reporting system, it is known that only a small percentage of these adverse reactions get reported, leading some researchers to estimate that the true numbers could be over 10 times that figure. The death count rises daily, and--if, as posited by many non-compromised scientists-- that theses "vaccines" actually result in the spread of Mad Cow Disease within 2 years--then the deaths from that alone will soon rise exponentially! No 5G activation needed, although that may well be part of the enemy's plan. They are now giving the vax to babies as young a 6-months old, with the government-run school systems and colleges now forcing it staff and students as a condition of participation in their system. Who needs abortion when more than half your population are volunteering themselves and their children, for their globalist masters' genocide? Get ready, folks, we're in for a very bumpy ride. And I am speaking here as a prepper, a patriot and as a conservative academic who does her homework.
@wildman1959 Can't wait to see your plan! I am in total agreement. No election should be considered valid that does not require paper ballots and photo ID, and monitored and counted by a open, non-partisan process. We must have a real "reset" of government, based on a revitalized electoral system. We must have a fresh start, as a country, as you describe, if we are to have any hope of survival.
I understand what prescient means, which is why spoke of what I DO know. Which is why I said giving people this evil and powerful even one more second to continue in this vein ,with power created and financed thanks to the people now being targeted for termination and subjugation, is no longer sensible, much less sane. We have numbers, millions of people, more than a match for the D.C. denizens and federales  ferreted away throughout the nation. We become less powerful, capable, and willing as older patriots die and leave us, so the sooner the better, whatever they have. Recon....by who, and of what...?

Hello everyone.  Finally made it back to this forum.  How is everyone doing?
:gun: It does not matter what the Suppository Court does.  The 2nd Amendment does not grant any Right; merely Protects the Right.  The Right is defined in the Declaration of Independence and emphatically states that it is an unalienable one granted by the Creator.  No matter what the :clown: :clown: :clown: :clown: :clown: :clown: :clown: :clown: :clown: believe or think, THEY AIN'T MAN'S CREATOR!

Though they may not be able to take down 2A. They can and will (I believe) tax gun ownership, licenses and ammo beyond the reach of the average lower to middle class Americans. 
:thinking: I will argue that they cannot tax an unalienable/inalienable Right.  The fiscal encumbrance of any unalienable/inalienable Right, therefore, is a violation of that Right and may lead to its destruction. For Example:  Churches are not taxed.

Unalienable/Inalienable means:  impossible to take away or give up.

A Right is free and unencumbered for execution by its owner.  Simply put (for the idiots in WaShitOn :poop: ) ownership and execution cannot be encumbered in any way.

The First Amendment begins, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting *the free exercise thereof*. The Founders did not limit "the free exercise thereof" to just the First Amendment.
Put in other words, "Shall Not Be Infringed".

The first set of results from the 2020 census are in, and reveal that the red state of Texas is set to gain two House seats, while California and New York will each lose one. This will bring the red state of Texas to a total of 38 seats and 40 electoral college votes - the 2nd highest behind California.

Also gaining seats are Colorado, Florida, Montana, Oregon and North Carolina, while states losing House seats also include Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

The states which gained seats are largely those won by former President Donald Trump (sic) in 2020, while states which Biden won during the election are "losers" according to BloomTurd.

Wait and see the overwhelming majority  we gain in the House and Senate in the 2022 mid term elections.

Who cares how many seats you have when you won't be deciding who fills them due to illegitimate elections....?When the people in counties are decidedly Republican, but Democrats end up in office because their candidate decides not to run again....?  Arizona has more anomalies and aberrations than you can shake a stick at....as do many other states....government can be and was meant to be a tool. People in government have turned it into a weapon, being used against the very people it was designed to serve....We will not be overthrowing the government. We will be removing the bad actors from within government. Not only legal, recommended and provided for by the Constitution....described as each citizens duty, to prevent tyranny....since criminals won't arrest, indite, nor prosecute THEMSELVES, the duty is ours.We have every right. Lets do this thing...
Quo warranto on Telegram...Tore....? I am uncertain of the meaning of this.....could you clarify...?
Totally agree!! Now we're talking turkey! Thinking future elections, in this situation, is going to solve this problem is like believing moving the deck chairs on the Titanic is going to stop it from sinking! Short of forming a new nation of the free (which I would fully support), I think that a movement of sweeping citizen's arrest of these globalist/Marxist thugs would is the next best thing.We need to do something *proactive* where WE (you and I) are working together, continually on the offensive, taking calculated actions that will change the narrative in our favor and rouse the people from their zombie-like slumber. Sounds much better to me than just reacting and losing more and more ground daily to our enemy, as we are currently. I volunteer to be part of the operation. Can't wait to sign up for a CSPOA posse in my county! Give me liberty or give me death.
Thanks lonestarhog, the ARISE info from CSPOA is noteworthy. The BigBatUSA.com site  a more detailed and comprehensive view of some wagons circling.....
Well, at least with this new Covidian compliance cult, we can easily identify who the sheep are. This new Religion of Woke requires that you turn off your brain, wear masks, take dangerous gene-altering drugs, and generally act like an asshole on stearoids. I want no part of that shit show!
Too many preachers have given over to the world instead of to the glory of His kingdom.  Many have fallen to the trappings of idol worship (the church organization, the community, the feeling of self worth through leadership) instead of the fearful worship of the Lord through unwavering sincere praise.  Church is not about the building, its contents, or structure, but spreading the Gospel to the faithful and most of all to the faithless.  Too many have been led astray and thus our great nation has fallen away like a lost sheep from its flock.  It is up to the faithful, in their humility and worshipfulness to a loving, living, and always faithful God, to lead the lost sheep back to the flock and restore the true Body of Christ to its rightful place.  This is something that is lost on many leaders in churches across the world, but not all.   There is hope from even the smallest of faith.   There is hope in the hearts of Godfearing men and women who must remind their church leadership of thier true calling. Like a mustard seed, brothers and sisters.
Yeah, its coming. I think its pretty bad. Took a trip down I10, honestly downtown Baghdad and J-Bad looked better. Things are going sideways fast. I think Jesus might show up here pretty soon. God bless brother, Ooorah, Semper Fi. Hang in there Devil Dog!

whatever you want to call them
yeah got a shallow well. Not digging the dissolved clay in the water though. Its probably safe to drink, but I buy water for coffee and to drink for now, Just use the well water for showers etc. Thinking about having a 6" deep well dug down to the dedrock and sealed casing which should get clear water, but that would cost 6 to 10k that I dont have at the moment
you said your Irish?
you have a water source?
Im looking into night vision or scopes to hunt hogs

I can wear two between my parents

Went to the Highland Games at Lake Norman near Statesville, NC and had a good laugh there. They had a historical section to one side. There was a fence with Highland Coos on the other side. Someone put a sign on the fence saying some clans were banned from getting near the coos since they were involved in an infamous cattle rustling a long way back. My clan was listed
I generally wear the rebel tartan to piss off english were ever I can
otherwise I wear MacIntyre or the military tartan for the Marine Corps
Yeah, I used to make lamb stew for the games
and give out my wine,whiskey,and beer
The one I have is the Hunting tartan Great kilt.
free of course, to avoid Law
Yeah I have a great
its just OD green
for hunting
I like to wrap up in my great in the cold
when I'm out setting in for a hunt
I generally got out a day or tweo
build a small fire
So thats a functional kilt. Interesting. Ive heard some use theirs in their everyday life, which makes sense in cold damp environs.
let it die down
move dirt over it, and set in
so I stay warm
wrap up, drop the kilt on it, sit in
and wait
Thats one reason why I got the Great. Since Im a prepper, everything I own has a dual purpose
yep, me too
I want to start bow hunting
save the ammo
plus, no sound
don't draw the assholes to us
when i was a kid, bow was better
my uncles took me
but I saw to young to draw a bow
Yut Yut
Semper Fi, do or die, gung ho, gung ho
Yut Yut
Tried that once. Bow season is during the warm months so the skeeters are bad. For the longest time kept my bow for backup (low ammo), then sold it to a young fellow that was hard on his luck. but needed to put food on the table. Bought another one like it because I could not bear to be without my backup
yeah, been there before
hey , this is one of my favs

yes,many times
Ireland, around 12 now

Went a little over a yeah and a half ago to take my father to visit some places he was interested in. Only time I was ever out of the country.  He did the DNA test and found out that we are related to 1 in 5 people in Donegal, Ireland. Current thought on this is that my ancestors migrated from Ireland to what became Scotland, then to the US. Although I was initially interested in Scotland more, now Im more interested in Ireland. The really ancient history of my family is there and you can see the evidence of it all over Ireland.
its still the same blood
its all Scot
and largely Norse
from when we conquered most of them
don';t get me wrong, I'm a devoted Christian, and totally believe in Jesus
our blood and our thing, we are a warrior race
and I know it
and believe in it
I can prove right now there is an agenda against white peoples
The red hair comes from Norse, but many think its from the Irish because many have red hair. My family has red hair except my Mom and I. Her line has native american close back and I got a dose of that. Yes, we come from a warrior race. Its why the south is like it is. Freakin communists will not like what they find down here
how many Irish songs do you know?
You dont have to prove it to me
anything European?
our history is being erased
its not racist to say so
no its true
then why are we being erased?
people need to think
I have black and brown friends in OK asking this too
why is white history getting deleted?
a friend of mine who is a african woman, a vet as well
pointed this out to me
she asked me, Mike, do you know Gaelic
can you speak Irish
Many different thoughts on this. Christianity largely spread throughout the world via european "white" cultures, especially American.
She told me, straight up
your history is rich and one that people love, but you dont speak it
how many Irish bars
no Irish, Celts
We dont speak it because much of it hasnt been taught from socialist/communist influence in our schools
and we get called racist
look at what the Irish endured
and thats our blood
Us being called racist is a TOOL to put us on the defensive
same old same old
we stick up for our kind
its the same way they rip down history
read a book
robert e lee was great
stuck up for black folks
first black churches and schools
all paid by them
Many people are going to find out the true meaning of racist when our people become polarized then become offensive. Its all orchestrated to make this happen to bring down our Constitutional Republic
yeah when men like you and me
true christians give the clothing and food to them
and be christ like
these people are nuts brother, we are living in clown world
Agreed. Hey its almost 8 here. I need to get busy. I'll be looking for land and Ill put the word out you are looking to relocate. We will find something.

Black Tip is legal in Texas.  I purchased mine several years ago for my M1 Garand 30-06.  Happy I did since it is virtually impossible to find.

Steel Core is illegal in: AK, CA, CT, IL, MA, NY, NJ, OK, Washington DC, RI, MD ..... The Great State of Texas ain't one of those.

Can't beat Texas, I loved living there. Then again I don't think you have open carry yet like NH and in NH you don't need a gun permit just your driver's license to prove your a citizen and you can buy what you'd like. Ammo at 7-Eleven? Walmart, Tractor Supply, and maybe a couple others I can't think of.
if that doesnt work a range commander 45 does the rest
I told him they probably gonna take me..but couple of you not going home tonight
i've never had anyone bow up

I just pulled up an article on that Facebook post. Now they're saying it was an unnamed officer who reposted the message from the Fall River PD. Attaching the article below.

Texas does have Open Carry.  We are now working on Constitutional Carry.  It passed the Texas House and is now in the DHS Committee - composed of gun-friendly Senators - and will be put for a full Senate vote.  Texans are burning up the phonelines telling them that we want Constitutional Carry.
I stand corrected. That's what NH enacted, Constitutional carry. I hope you have success. 
Mine was good with the family and I felt safe in Eastern TN. Everywhere I looked people carrying, some open, and not too many no guns allowed signs. Patriots everywhere you could tell. 
And masks? Shit over half not wearing a stupid mask. Felt normal finally. And distancing? Shit we went to an aquarium on a rainy day it was packed, 6 inches maybe lol
And I just wanted my kids to have fun just in case that‚Äôs the last time
Hey DaveyE7, I've done more digging into the subject of repeaters. That cheap little device that I posted is what they refer to as a parrot repeater. Prone to issues and not reliable. 
I've found what I consider to be the perfect package. Though a separate battery pack is required. I posted three vids about it on the Comms. VHF/UHF page. 
I saw that I need to look at those articles. 
Fall River huh? Who would have thought that
You may recall how military comms always had braided gaskets to seal the container from outside interference. These have that.
Good morning Patriots!

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Yup, but shit rolls down hill, now they're blaming it on a lower ranking LEO
I saw that. Yes I remember that about the gaskets on our survival radios
We got bored and took an old broken one apart
Good morning NC OKers! 
And jpj has pointed out that a repeater to be any good at all must incorporate a duplexer and these have that right inside a neat little package 
Agreed SR is playing chess and they are losing. I know he doesn‚Äôt want us hung up on one man but his leadership and guidance are crucial to our needs and goals. Need more like him
Has he commented on them yet, didn‚Äôt notice that
No, no one has.

:moneybag: We Need Sound Money
https://www.jsmineset.com/wp-content/uploads/live/138a7fcd80f2_982C/image_thumb.png

Hog :cowboy:
no, we need each other
barter is fine
or some good olde patriotism
money means nothing compared to our freedom
money is stock in blood
on which government holds it
in the end it means who holds a gun to ones face, which is America to the rest of the world
most of you are completely ignorant to violence
and you have no idea what true pain is
:thinking: Throughout the history of Man, the medium of exchange has been such things as:  gold, silver, salt, spices, chickens, pelts, wives, goats, horses, tulips...anything that people will accept as currency.  Barter works between two people, or a very small group with various talents what could be traded.  Barter does not work for a civilized and industrialized society.

Sound Money that a person has in his/her possession is the repository of a lifetime of work.  Baseless fiat currency robs people of their lifetime of work.

 Paper currency that is exchangeable for a hard asset (e.g. gold, silver) - which was convertible into gold at any financial institution until April 1933 - that does NOT lose value over time is required and should be demanded by We The People.  Problem?  We The People can't even define 'money'.  I know, since it is one of the first questions that I ask in my seminars.  We The People are COMPLETELY ignorant as to how our financial system works, since the criminal Federal Reserve of 1913, and the supporting Income Tax.  Yeah, Income Tax came into being in 1913.  Funny, huh?

Note:  That "gun to ones face, which is America to the rest of the world" is the Reserve Currency (aka US Dollar).  That Reserve Currency is going to be replaced and America will find itself in a whole different world.

Hog :cowboy:
Thanks. Semper fi ! I don't think anyone will miss what's coming, like it or not....
Yeah they are disappointing to say the least. Probably why I clashed with a lot of them when still in. 
I like Trump, voted for Trump, and supported  much of what he did to bring the extent of corruption in government into the spotlight. I will never understand how someone with 70 million people on his coattails, hanging on his every word, could fail to bring those citizens into a more active role than mere cheerleading. He failed miserably, in my estimation, as Stewart has quite clearly pointed out. Looks more like Chinese checkers than 3-D Chess
Lead acid batteries are NG. Heavy and low output. For the longest time I was stuck on lithium-ion batteries. Though as good as they are they are cold sensitive. So using them for a remote repeater would not fit. But Lifepo4 batteries are much more forgiving and have close to the same ratings. See attached;
https://www.batterystuff.com/kb/articles/battery-articles/lifepo4-lithium-iron-powersport-batteries-cold-weather-performance.html
not really, the only real power in this world is power held with a weapon
anyone who thinks otherwise is a fool, or simply grew up lame and simple
its the will to pull the trigger and take power
More good stuff on LiFePO4 batteries. 

https://lithiumhub.com/lifepo4-batteries-what-they-are-and-why-theyre-the-best/
I will check them out. Just finished watching all 3 videos on the repeater. Looks really good. That test with hand helds was good, 6 miles with trees etc in the way
:skull_crossbones: The strongest and most deadly weapon is financial.  The United States has had the World's Reserve Currency since the Bretton Woods agreement in 1944.  The stronger the Federal Reserve became and the more corrupt the US Government became the Reserve Currency was used as a nuclear financial weapon against every other country.  The Reserve Currency was backed by gold - per the Bretton Woods agreement - until August 1971 when Nixon defaulted on the world.  Kissinger had been working with the Oil Producing Nations to establish the Petro Dollar.  Now the Reserve Currency took on a different air.  Now the US Government had no financial constraints (i.e. gold) and spending went exponential (i.e. debt).  Any country that attempted to interfere with the Petro Dollar (e.g. Libya) was destroyed.

No weapon is as strong as the nation that controls the world's finances; in this case by owning the Reserve Currency.

I need to dig out my old cb and get that going to start getting back into it. Not sure what‚Äôs left of the connections I had in my car way back when. My dad is all thumbs and he tore it out of my car when he had to junk it years ago. He cut the antenna cable because he could not figure out how to route it back through the trunk lid lol
skill have a gun to your head, so do I
I wanted to play around with the Baofeng on vacay but the kids and I had too much fun. Tried to reconnect with the fianc√©e too so that was important 
the difference is, Im the tyranny of evil men
I just did it for ribbons and medals
That cb probably needs an antenna for sure and maybe the connections on the back as well.
That repeater is great though
but the best part is, I got out quicker
and I have stuff to hang on the wall
Sounds like a well earned vacation 
Hands down for a backup system at a camp. For the money and the amp hr you get from them you can't beet the Tesla model 3 modules taken from the big onboard battery system. 850 to 1250 and you get a lot of battery. I plan on stacking 6 of them. And running a 48 volt system. The higher the voltage the lower the amperage and you can run smaller wire. Plus now they have AC units that run on 48 volts so you can run straight from the battery bank and don't have to put that heavy load through a transformer that eats power.
We need each other. Together we are strong. Divided we are week. Barter is good. Patriotism is the foundation of who we are as a nation, and a must have. Without freedom money is nothing. Sound money is a repository of a lifetime of work, if you have physical possession of gold or silver (real money). If the government holds the money to purchase or black-male, then patriotism is bought from or stolen from honorable people. Then the gun and violence and control will be pointed at whoever has the money and power chooses.  I am a medic, I have seen pain and death when my only goal is to preserve life. This is a hard road for all of us. To preserve the greatest nation on earth the road will be rough. We must each find our strongest asset and use it to build and maintain a well oiled machine that will plow through the hardships of the transition we are in. I am grateful to be among real patriots that will stand up to be counted.
My kinda guy! Go Madmarine!
:moneybag: Barter can always be a medium of exchange, between two people or a small group.  However, it is not capable of being effective in a society.  How will you pay your electric bill, food bill, medical, car purchase, etc....Tell me how barter can work outside of a small group.  Barter can also exist at the same time as a sound money system.  It just cannot stand alone.

Hog :cowboy:
I don't disagree with any of you
Just pointing out the other side, I work for them
The lithium-ion just need a heating pad and thermostat so they can keep themselves above I think it's 35¬∞f? 
In a well insulated enclosure it's not that hard to do. Not sure if you're up on the biggest difference between lithium and lead acid? Lead acid amp hour ratings are only to 50% capacity. If you run them below 50% you cut their lifespan drastically. Lithium run at full output down to about 10% with no degradation. And their lifespan is 10 times lead acid.

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=FDjnFkCny4MJv54i2) :question: MadMarine, a question, if I may.  You said, "I work for them".  How do you feel about working extremely hard and, in some cases, risking your life, only to be paid in debt.  You supply your labor, and the employer thanks you and gives you a piece of paper upon which you now owe interest.  Worse yet, your employer will create as much paper as he wants, which decreases the value of your paper.  If your employer allows your paper to decrease in value by 2% per year, at the end of ten years you have lost 20%.  If you put your paper away for say fifty years, you have lost 100%.  (Simple for illustrative purposes)

The video was only to illustrate the writ of quo warranto, I didn't watch the whole thing so I don't know what all was said. On Telegram, there are segregated groups indeed pursuing that approach. There are other groups actively pursuing other approaches as well. As for the reasons why Trump did or didn't do, there is much speculation but no one knows for certain. Personally, I suspect that he simply didn't have the loyalty and support of his closest "advisors" and those who would have been responsible for carrying out his orders - everything else that transpired is just noise.

Only GOD may judge me!!....i asked a ole preacher once ...after all ive done..why would he still want me in .heaven?...he said son, God needs warriors against the devil!!!, not weak men...Jesus carries a flaming sword and knows how to use it...i always liked that awnser...
:pray: At a prayer meeting, our group was individually asked, "Why do you believe you will go to Heaven?"

There were many good Biblical answers, like, "Because I accept Jesus as my Savior.".....and....."Since my Confirmation I have been one of God's warriors.".....and....."I obey His words and do not stray from Him."

Sigh!  Then came my turn.  I simply said, "Because it can't be Heaven until I get there." :innocent: 

To this day it was worth the plethora of looks on so many faces.  Luckily, the Priest had a good Irish sense of humor, and I often served Mass with him on Sunday.

This channel is setup to read scripture as a group.  SOAP is Scripture, Observation, Application and Prayer.  We start with Chapter 1 of a Book.  I'm suggesting Gospel of John or Ephesians for the first book.

Here is how it works.  Each day we all ready the same chapter.  Then post a short message that identifies one versus from that chapter that stood out to you personally...that's the S.  Next why did it stand out to you... My an Observation, short and brief, that's the O.  Next how does it apply to your life, for the A. Finally, a short prayer asking how God might apply the words to your life.  Easy right?  Well, I will do the first one so you can jump in or just read what people post.
After reading the first half of Ch 1 in John... Here a sample SOAP

S// The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. John 1:14 NIV https://bible.com/bible/111/jhn.1.14.NIV  
O// John opens the book describing the WORD and his role in creation.  Then here in this vs he connects us directly as individuals to the glory of that creation.   
A// I am created in the glory of God for his grace and truth.  His grace is more beautiful that anything he created.  Hard to comprehend this at times because his creative powers are unmatched in the universe. 
P//  Lord teach me to live in full understanding of your grace as it is more significantly beautiful than anything else you've created for us to enjoy...amen.

Hey guys, I started a channel #SOAP-Bible-Reading check it out if your interested in reading through John together using the SOAP method.  Check out the channel if you have never heard of this technique.

:dove: Shalom & Blessings OathKeeper Brethren! i'm up to my neck in Evangelical Minister course, almost reading the Holy Book for a living now! i will observe when i can & partake if inspiration presents itself!:pray:
S// He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.  John 1:10 ESV
O// Describes how the Messiah came to live in the flesh among men, yet men did not recognize him and would ultimately reject and crucify him.  Reminds me how today‚Äôs world has ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù and rejected the word (Christ).
A// I read the word to remind myself of my faith in the Lord, no matter how small that faith may be, and need to be reminded daily that He is with me lest I fall to the pit of pride and sin.
P// Almighty God, whose grace I don‚Äôt deserve, please keep your presence in my heart and remind me of your faithfulness so that I can not lose what faith I have in these times of tribulation.  In the name of Jesus Christ I ask this and offer to you my praise of praises.  Amen.

Kerry's betrayal of Israeli intelligence and attempted cover-up of the whole affair is even worse. If true--and if this wasn't an un-elected Marxist dictatorship running the country--this would more than qualify as treason. We are assailed by an unprecedented evil on every front, foreign and domestic. I can only pray that  i the U.S. military will intervene and stop this travesty to continuing any further ‚úö

:coffin: Merriam-Webster adds new definition of ‚Äòvaccine‚Äô so Covid ‚Äòvaccines‚Äô can be defined as such

Merriam-Webster, the dictionary company that has built a reputation for pandering to the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù crowd and embracing leftist government mandates, has quietly played their own role in pushing the Covid-19 ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù out to the general public. They added a new definition to their listing for the word ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù to match what‚Äôs currently being offered to the American people to fight the coronavirus.

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=enej3fbLyxeAijNR8) My guess is that it's the end. A court led by Roberts, Sotomayor, Breyer, Kagan and a surprise shift by Gorsuch will beat out Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. They will state that Heller was incorrectly decided that that the right to bear arms does not exist outside of service in a "well-regulated militia". Either that, or they will throw cold water on all future challenges in gun cases and confirm that 2nd Amendment issues are decided with "middling scrutiny" rather than "strict scrutiny" - meaning that gun regulations can be upheld as long as they are reasonably related to some compelling government objective (e.g. public safety) and do not amount to an outright ban on guns in the home.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=Ohuc1b4hgJRlEdsXB) I agree. In the Obamacare decision, Roberts basically opened the door to this.  They could put all guns under the purview of the NFA and adjust the tax for inflation to $4,500.00.  Then they could tax ammo at 1,000%.
I was told that they are vetting state level leaders and that vetting of newer members will start soon, I just haven't heard much because attention is being focused on the baseless KKK Act lawsuit.
I still contend that they cannot tax a Right.  None of our Rights are taxed nor financially encumbered.  Why would the 2nd Amendment PROTECTED Right be different?

Hog :cowboy:
Sadly I think that's where they are headed! 
Thanks for posting @BasedInTexas .  The direction of the courts regarding 2A is headed in one direction and one direction only: infringing.

I am of the mind, INFRINGE AWAY!  

Tax the hell out of firearm purchases, ban semiautos, ban removable magazines, prohibit the sale of firearms to anyone with unpaid parking tickets, regulate shooting ranges out of business, force federal registration of gun purchases to names and addresses of gun buyers, outlaw gun shows, prohibit the sale and purchase of reloading equipment and components, prohibit conceal and open carry, require background checks on ammo purchases, end online sale of firearms and supplies, require a federal permit to own and transport firearms, prohibit interstate transport of personal firearms, federalize all gun laws across all states, require VISA and M/C to report all previous gun purchases to the feds for the purpose of retro gun registration, tie gun ownership to Social Security numbers and employ the IRS to exact fines for violation of federal gun laws, and begin door-to-door gun confiscation. 

INFRINGE AWAY. Sooner the better!

Maybe that's what it takes to wake up sleeping patriots to the Marxist election coup of 2020.
Big Hog, there are a lot of things they're doing that they should not be doing! The question becomes how is it stopped? Not going to happen from the week Republicans and RINOs in Congress and Senate. We can hope that this recent census will bring about a swift change in majority in the House and Senate. That's the only peaceful option I see.
I think I may have freaked out Hog while you were on sabbatical. I remembered you mentioning something about him being into reloading his own ammo. So he and I set up a OTR here on our site for last Sunday morning and I broke down my suggestion of molding our own lead or zink bullets with a little spice. He wasn't into the idea and I fear I may have spooked him? Maybe he is ex LEO and maybe I should just forget about it?
SSGT, I believe we have to rely on State Nullification of Unconstitutional Federal Laws, the refusal of Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers to enforce same, the Do Not Comply of Patriots.  These are all peaceful and legal.

However, it is prudent to 'plan for the worst', and be prepared to protect the Rights of We The People by any means necessary.  Period!  Full Stop!

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=FuYbFXlcHi7oRCxRY) @ssgtgman  while I do appreciate your optimism, the 2020 election coup demonstrates the Left has effectively ended free and fair elections in America---until the next civil war is concluded.
I believe MM4212 is correct because fear is the most powerful weapon. The background on controlling the world starts with Stalin and Mao sitting together to explore Marxism. Marx held that peasants couldn't be controlled, they are self-sufficient and have nothing to lose. Creating a society with a middle class gives the people a state to belong to and depend upon, thus loss of independence and beginnings of control. Government then exerts socialist programs and state control until the people are completely helpless and full blown communism can be maintained. We're seeing the beginning of socialist makings as our country is entirely dependent upon our industrialized way of life. The United States has kept China and Russia at bay,becoming a light for the free world. Corrupted from within, which is treasonous, and its lights out. Patriots will have to put the fear of God into  the mix, since a fear of socialism and communism does not appear to exist...
The number of purchased politicians, which all of them are, is not a factor of any consequence in stopping corrupt government. It could only further government control, if anything. Our government has gone rogue. This dog will not hunt. Period.
WM1959, Among the many things that Real President Trump realized and countered was that THEY can no longer be allowed to control the Means of Production (i.e. foreign manufacturing).  To have allowed the continuation would have then "...exerts socialist programs and state control until the people are completely helpless and full blown communism can be maintained."  The power of We The People is in self-sufficiency and independence.  THEY are now rushing to undo all that he set in place.  THEY will not succeed.

Hey good morning. I don‚Äôt know if you freaked him out necessarily. He seems to be a thinking man maybe he is mulling the idea or just dismissed it entirely which I would think is not a good idea personally. 
Agreed. This situation will not be solved by elections or protests. We will have unite, organize ight at some point, if we are restore our individual freedoms and national sovereignty. The sooner the better. in my opinion. The longer we wait, the harder the task will be.
Good morning all, feeling under the weather this morning. I agree with wildman this government has gone rogue and we cannot count on anything being resolved peacefully. Maybe they won‚Äôt come door to door collecting guns but tax them to the point that ownership is impossible. As has been stated on here before, what is everyone‚Äôs line in the sand that you will make your stand on? As much as I would want a peaceful solution and pray there will be one, not counting on it at all. Stay strong and hold the line all and make your decision now where is that point you will not accept anymore bs from this rogue group called our government, ALL of them...
Windy, the republic: are you american?   Great video, spot on. We need to focus on push back, what we patriots are going to do, not continually mull over the constant flagrant violations of our rights as if understanding how badly we are being railroaded does anything to stop it.
Seems like we all came down with something, we all slept like shit and I called out today. That‚Äôs only the 4th time in like 35+ years of working I have called out intentionally. No fever so no one can say the scam virus just a damn head cold is all
Trump had the most important element in this fight. Millions of people who would have jumped when he called. For any reason. The rest of us have hundreds of reasons by now and any number of causes, not close to amounting what he had; 70 million citizens, or more, who KNOW our government is corrupt, and would love the chance to do what they could to see that end.
Some push back, not a lot but some

I hear you there. I hope you and your clan get well quickly. 
And I'm around if you get bored and want to talk.
So tell me, you are getting your HAM or have it, where do I start?
I am studying for it but not as much as I should because I love researching antenna designs and that ammo thing. I  guess you could say I distract myself.
But go to the ARRL website and order the ringed manuals, technicians class and general class. If feel confident they will let you take both tests back to back for the one test fee.
Though not to be misleading, you have to score a passing grade on the technicians test before they allow you to take the general test
FYI, There are three license levels and you gain more legal access to the HAM frequency spectrum as you work your way up to the Amateur Extra license. The only thing outside of that that you can get that is HAM related is the MARS license. I believe you can go for the MARS trainee license after receiving your technicians license but you must have your general license in order to get the full MARS certification or license.

If you want to wake up the sleeping giant, get off your keyboard and start organizing in your communities.  Start marches, print and distribute flyers, perform civil demonstrations, get so loud and in the face of the enemy that even his propaganda arm (MSM) has to pay attention.  Generate fear from the Left and embolden the Right.  Stop waiting for a hot war that may never come, and start fighting on the current battlefield.  Many of you have the time and inclination to do this.  Do your part and wake up the giant!
Most important though: Do it peacefully and within the bounds of the Constitution!
:fire: Well, the "keyboard" and the Internet are the most peaceful weapons, and feared by the Commies.  Organizing, meeting, educating, preparing, etc. are all accomplished to a very efficient degree by time spend on the keyboard.  The keyboard is also a viable peaceful tool to "get in the face of the enemy".

Once the keyboard is no longer used, and its peaceful function is no longer efficient, then all that it accomplished will go kinetic and Commies will rue the day that they awakened The Sleeping Giant.

It will take a little longer but for blacks to accept that their own people are using them cause 99 %  have been raised to stick together. But lies from anyone or any group always catches up with them in time. Just like high gas and food prices affects the poorer first. Like illegals in the country takes unskilled jobs from the unskilled legal blacks. Blacks was once the majority of brick and block masons the Mexicans took that,  Blacks had the lawn care service, Mexicans took that, Whites framed houses, Mexicans took that. I have a lot of black friends and they all know too many blacks will " act a fool " when pulled over or questioned by the police. Every one of them has had a friend killed by another black. Like I told my best friend that's black and was my best man, no one does something for nothing just look at what there is too gain for the ones coaching them on. He works with me when I do HVAC work and we talk a lot. Blacks can hustle with the best of them and you can't hustle a hustler at least not forever.  They are coming around to see BLM is  BS. Democrats are using them. it's that darn free dollar that's slowing down them seeing the light and being raised to believe a certain way only. The police would much rather have a nice quiet day than the BS they are accused of.
Later on my patriots I got to go.
BLM is just an evolution from Black Panthers and Nation of Islam.  BLM will evolve into another hustler movement.  The real solution is to get to the psychology of "blackness" and get our black brothers and sisters to realize their skin color doesn't define them, their actions do.
Also, get the rhetoric from both parties to change from "You can't do it without us" to "you can do anything you put your mind to" and get rid of the racial boogie man.
Until that happens, blacks will continue to be pawns and too many will continue to wallow in self defeat.
Hog, Well said as usual. ;^)

Ok great thanks I will start looking at this more seriously. I guess I have been interested in this stuff before and during my AF days just kinda lost sight of it in the workings of life. Now it is more necessary
Agreed, we can keep each other motivated and tracking.

We learned some stuff from the user stand point using the AF issued survival radios and their preset freqs. The newer classified GPS capable radios I last used in the AOR we could change the frequencies when warranted by higher command. We just never did anymore than programming and normal user inspections. No break downs or repairs that was all done by someone else as needed
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=DkNazgR8D4dpqqBwu) Hoorah for these parents!  But my takeaway on this article is a bit different than @zephius . 

When I read this article I noticed right away how fast LE arrived at the request of this leftwing school board.  The school board called 911 and LE arrived in "just over a minute."  Hmmm.

I hope these brave parents don't get a visit from FBI on charges of...
*+  "willfully and knowingly engaging in an act of physical violence on public property,"*
*+  "attempting an act to obstruct, impede or interfere with official functions of government," *or 
*+  "knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority."*

Zephius, the Left is not inclined to give up any of their gains. Not peacefully.
I used the URC64, PRC90 and the PRC112 series up to the G model. I am sure they have advanced even further
Apparently they do. Of course if we bring up MLK that‚Äôs a no no
I agree Keeping AZ the lefties will not give up, but neither did the parents. We The People need to do more of this at the grass roots level and with proper research and knowing exactly where you stand legally to do this type of thing. That way we may be able to start making headway and gain back lost ground

Did you see that they raided Giuliani's home office and seized his electronics! Fucking Gestapo! 
All you got to do is fight tooth and nail and never ever give up, give in or back up one inch. Be relentless,  whatever it takes to win is what you do nothing else matters. There's two spirits good and evil God and Satan there's no middle ground. Evil/Satan's children must at any and all cost be defeated or they will ruin everything good cause evil can't stand good it evil's nature that's what evil is suppose to do, to try to destroy good. They will lose in the long run but they will do a lot of damage until then. I never thought I would see what I see going on now.
Everything is well with me and mine, enjoying life.  Just trying to get my soul brothers and sisters to see the light and not be the left's fool for their vote. I've never like seeing someone taken advantage of. I've seen  too many black kids in schools not have a fair chance at life because of the democratic welfare system of entrapment. Kids are innocence just like animals and old people all three should never be taken advantage of. It isn't right and it's no way to treat people for the end result of making a dollar which is what it all comes down too. Power is money. I always thought people would be smarter as time went on but they have gotten more corrupt. I suppose I was thinking thru the eyes of a fair person not someone lusting for money.
Don't forget that God tells us that he always prevails and Evil was already defeated by Christ on the cross.  With faith in and fear of God we cannot fail.
The fights are local. The marxists can pass any law they want, but it‚Äôll take massive manpower to enforce. Good luck to them w that.
Citizens really need to stop fearing being called names like "Racist" or "Nazi" and start demanding their cities refuse to defund their local LEOs.  The Dems goal is to nationalize the police forces and further militarize them against the citizen in preparation for the new Marxist Revolution.
Thanks for taking the time to respond.  We live in challenging times.  There is a tremendous amount of manipulation out there and like you I believe the regressives (what I call the progressives) are taking people down the track to their own ruin and everyone else's.

....But this fight is not really about Giuliani or Trump, is it? Its much bigger than them. This is about you and I, and all free Americans who would preserve the hope of freedom and liberty for their children; who, but for our decision today will not otherwise know it. We have been blessed beyond our comprehension to have inherited the mantle of our Founding Fathers. To be worthy of it, we must now accept responsibility for our own freedom, and do what they expected of us. Now is the time for us to be adults, to unite and fight. If our beloved brothers, Donald and Rudy, wish to join us, the more the merrier! But let us not allow our freedom to depend on what they decide to (or not to) do. This is our fight! And ultimately not even for us--but for our grandchildren, for the future of humanity and for Christ. These are the eternal values America stands for. We owe it to them to return what has been given to us through the sacred blood of their sacrifice. Time for us to choose who we will serve. I will gladly give my life for this cause.

Yes that is probably more dangerous than some other thjngs

Love my dog, a boxer what is yours? 
Beagle. He barks at everything and is very protective of the little boy
Protective is good, I can do without the barking though. Our youngest daughter's cocker spaniel does that when he visits and that pulls my dog into it. His bark is loud.
I don‚Äôt mind him barking as long as he will learn when we say it‚Äôs ok, stop! That‚Äôs his thing, he doesn‚Äôt stop
Stopping is good. üò≥
Beagles are a good breed of dog.
They are and he has his good moments. Drives me crazy because I did not want a dog. Knew I would get stuck with him and of course that happened. 
I'll bet your son loves him though

You went to Tennessee to your camp? I noticed that the ebay guy selling those Tesla batteries was in Tennessee.?
We did go to TN. We rented a cabin after we got canceled last year

You probably didn't see this being local news. But the other day here in Winthrop a bus driver raped a passenger who missed her stop and ended up being the last person on the bus with him. I think he's a towel head!
I'll look
Mount Juliet
Damn! No did not hear about that! Lots of fucking evil around
Mt Juliet is in the middle of TN. We were in the eastern portion
Not that other ethnicities don't rape but the towel heads are the worst when it comes to disrespecting women 
You are not wrong. They are very bad towards women which is archaic to say the least

Good morning, All!
Yes that happens felt like that afterwards
And exhausted 
That was just 5 seconds
I've been hit at least a dozen times over my 25 years working on elevators. Probably 680 volts DC was the worst. The muscles across your chest and arms hurt
I can believe it. That 5 seconds felt like an eternity 
I Have done that on a treadmill a few times too
Can't troubleshoot without power
Well there are times you have to do it hot
Yes but I have been forgetful also lol
That's how it happens sometimes, other times being sweaty and the perfect conductor 
It sure does remind you that you're alive!
I have unplugged a treadmill before and forgot to run the capacitor out using the walking belt and got shocked enough to get my attention
Yup those caps bite
I once had a plan of building a raccoon kill trap with big caps. The wife stopped me cause of neighbor cats and such possibly stepping on it.
Lol that would have solved 2 problems
I have thought of doing something like that as a security option on a bug out vehicle. Once inside turn them on and if someone were to try and open the door, "Zap"!
That‚Äôs an idea
Would work well 
Yes isn't it üòâ
I registered on ARRL yesterday 
Could do it to the cabin or house door knobs to
Gonna look into it more this weekend 
I was thinking that too or your RV doors 
Oh good. Did you order your first two study guides?
No this weekend after pay day
Had to pay my sons cost shares yesterday 
I think they were $35 each
That‚Äôs good 
Or just get the technicians book. No big need to rush past that
Especially if you don't plan on getting into the HF bands on the lower spectrum 
True I figure get both of the first 2 done then think about the third level. 
My idea is as much capability as possible
That's my plan. If you prepare for it you'd save the money on the second book by only paying for one test when taking them back to back
Both tests are 35 questions 
I think so? Multiple choice out of something like 400
Sounds like an AF promotion test
I think the third test is 50 questions 
The higher up you go the more electronics oriented it becomes 
And that‚Äôs as much legal capability you can get
That and if you go for the MARS license.  That opens up a wider spectrum. Civilian operators assisting the government or military 
Ahhh ok that one I would think about
I wrote about that to you yesterday.
You did
I wasn‚Äôt with it yesterday 
There are also GMRS, MURS & something else? Only an application for those licenses. I will buy my GMRS when my radio arrives. $35 for a ten year license 
I have GMRS already
Good boy üòâ
Isn‚Äôt it just the HAM levels and that‚Äôs it?
GMRS, MARS, HAM?
Well the MARS operates between the HAM frequencies. And I was just about to say that for no other reason than to be in the MARS loop in a SHTF scenario.  Though you can open up the MARS frequencies for monitoring without going through all of the work of getting that license. 
True and no matter what we are being monitored 
Cause you can listen in on anything 
The HAM license test is only HAM related, though they may throw a question in there on if operating on 467Mhz is legal on your HAM radio. That would be a no!
Speaking of radios and legality have not seen jpj lately
And you mean the 467Mhz spectrum 
And 467 freq
Yes, not sure on that. He is hurting financially from since 9/11. His tech security business was mainly in the twins. He hasn't rebounded since, then the covid lock downs in the Communists states like his. NYC
467 being in the GMRS zone. 
That sounds right and familiar 
Yes that‚Äôs right
But if you are GMRS licensed you can as long as your power meets requirements?
That is part of the Baofeng controversy. It can be programmed to cover more spectrum than is legal. Part 95 and 97 touch on how they (fcc) have banned radios that cover too much. Must be a pay off from the manufacturers to sell more equipment! 
Ahhh yes now I remember that discussion
My Baofeng has no FCC ID
Another reason he said not to get one and rely on it
Not if your radio is a HAM certified radio. No GMRS or MURS frequencies. That's why they say to hold on to your Baofeng radios for SHTF. Then the laws won't be so important. But on a normal OK gathering, they won't let you operate a Baofeng on FRS, or GMRS, to keep the heat off of us.
Yes that I remember and it‚Äôs why I bought 2 more FRS/GMRS radios

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=8ueYtXzW1s6htv6GX) I don't think there will be taxes on existing gun because they will want to ensure compliance with registration requirements. For example, with the pistol braces, we already know they are gonna put those under the NFA - but I think they will declare an "NFA Tax Holiday" for 90 - 120 days and allow owners of these weapons to register them tax free and without legal penalty.  They don't really care about the $200.00.  It's just a "sin tax".  What they really care about is knowing which guns are where - and since many of these weapons are AR and AK platforms - they would rather know where those guns are for the purpose of enforcing future mandatory "buy backs"
To go with my older smaller Unidens
They primarily use FRS. But as you know GMRS overlaps some FRS frequencies. The problem then becomes, you are supposed to announce your call sign at the beginning, end and at least every 10 minutes on a GMRS radio. And jpj said the ant & blm scum write down your call sign and eather hijack it or as with a HAM call sign, there are lists where they can find your name and address. 
Yes that‚Äôs right. What assholes
Not sure if GMRS is listed the same way but probably is
I have the FCC GMRS page bookmarked I will have to look
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=nToqbyE7XRqzfqfW8) I think we need to understand black culture first. I really hate to say this, but it would appear to me that blacks have a greater tendency toward groupthink than other races. I think we see this in the way they vote; with well over 90% of blacks voting Democrat. There is a phrase we use in business: if everyone in the room is thinking the same thing, a lot of the people in the room are not thinking. There is a culture that needs to be changed, and that is going to take a lot of time and hard work. A good place for them to start would be for black youth to look up to people like Clarence Thomas and Tim Scott (on the right) or even Barack Obama and Colin Powell (on the left). It doesn't matter whether the role models they have are on the political spectrum; it only matters that they ARE NOT people who act, play basketball, or sing about police brutality for a living.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=fwvLenMR8wmJjSGcM) I am not so sure about that. I am glad there are lots of LEOs in Oathkeepers. However, it has been my experience with LEOs that far too many of them care about only one thing: their pension. They are happy to trample constitutional right to ensure they receive that pension they worked so hard for. That is why I think the police pension is in need of some serious reform. Instead of contributing to a pension, perhaps require a shift into a different kind if asset in which the officer has a lot more control. I may be ignorant about this (and please - by all means - feel free to correct me) but I don't like the idea of officers having this big lifetime payout at the end of their careers that is conditioned on them essentially obeying all orders without question for 30 years (or however long the typical career is). A system like that can easily be abused and I would like to see something where its harder to punish an officer for doing their constitutional duty to NOT obey unlawful orders.
Yup I am glad we have those.  I see there are a lot of people in OK with HAM radio licenses and I wanted to look into getting mine. Perhaps one of y'all can refer me to someone so I can work on that while I wait?  I don't like being idle in my free time

_What they really care about is knowing which guns are where...._  @BasedInTexas 

Gun registration is coming. The govt will want to account for---register---all new gun purchases so they know WHO has WHAT. 

The bigger problem for the govt is identifying who owns what PRIOR to establishment of a gun registration program. I think we can assume the NSA scooped all firearm purchase info paid via credit and debit/bank cards. Debit and credit card purchases will account for most gun purchases within the last 30 years.  

Americans are terrified of the IRS, conservative and liberal alike. It stands to reason the Left will tie gun registration and its enforcement to the IRS, a well established and ubiquitous federal agency.
...remember how Obama and the Left tied their healthcare mandate to your taxes? Yup. IRS.

The Federal Reserve was established in 1913.  The IRS was established in 1913.  Coincidence?  No!  In a Debt Based Monetary System, which requires the payment of interest on the so-called money, it is necessary to tax the people.

The IRS is the strong-arm of the FED.

Thank you, Hog, for this horrifying update re, the VFW and NG policies appearing to pressure Americans with a "vaccine passprot." Based on this information, I agree with you that there is serious reason to question these organizations' intentions, in their spread of NWO gospel of the luciferian jab indocrination.

Sweet! Unfortunately, at this point, I think we need a lot more than MAGA rallies. Just more kicking the can down the road, waiting for Trump to figure out what he wants to do, while the enslavement and the vaccine genocide of the American people continues. By the way, you all know that Trump continues his wholehearted support of the vaccines, right? His "Operation Warpspeed" is what started all this vax thing, and in his interview just the other day (with Sean Hannity, I believe) Trump actually criticized Biden for pausing the Johnson and Johnson jab! Seriously, Mr. President? After all we now know about the Covid/Vax BS??? Jeez, give me a break!
They‚Äôre all in it together...
Windy, I am just a confused about him and his comments/stance about Da Jab.

You gave a Thumbs Up to the X22 Report that I just posted.  He and I have been saying virtually the same things (about 90%).  Trump is playing a very dangerous game that requires Spiritual Intervention and Guidance.  He must choose his battles and, I believe, he understands that like in any war, there will be collateral damage.  He has stated that in all cases Da Jab is voluntary.  He knows the truthful information that is available, but only if people take the time to become educated prior to making such a serious decision.  For the sheep who take Da Jab, then it was their decision and will have to live or die with the consequences.

An urgent message from my dear friend, American patriot and sister in Christ, Peggy Hall, in Huntingdon Beach, California. A call to conscience on the face mask tyranny we can no longer afford to ignore. What we must now truly ask ourselves (just between you ,me, and in the presence of our Creator) is what are we are actually *doing* in this, the fight of our lives? As I have been saying myself, with increasing urgency, is that it is time for us to choose--as evidenced by our actions, not just our words--which side we are we on. Peggy nails it here. THIS IS AN ALL-OR-NOTHING PROPOSITION. Let's face it, wearing a mask at ANY TIME--unless we happen to be doing surgery, have tuberculosis or are or working with hazardous materials--is the unequivocal symbol of this new brand of communism, and an unequivocal symbol of submission to tyranny--END OF STORY. We might as well be digging our own graves! If our sister in Kommie-fornia can do it, so can we! Now more than ever, may this be a call to backing up our faith with ACTIONS. Regardless of the consequences, as at the rate things are going, we never know if it will be the last one we get. We have moved way past the hope of rallies and the ballot box saving our Republic. This is a life and death issue for us. We cannot continue to call ourselves "patriots" and compromise with evil. Live free or die @S4A1-GA #SOAP-Bible-Reading @Nationalvp  #FL ‚úö

4/30 1st half of John 2
Speaking with other patriots, Oath Keeper and Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association members, it is undeniable there are many citizens who feel the control slipping from our hands, and would love to see something surface that could arrest the sad spiral downward this nation is experiencing. If there were such a thing.....? What is missing is the confidence to gather and determine a common focal point, coupled with the belief that we MUST and CAN change our trajectory. Thinking outside the box is, I believe, where the answers lie. We keep trying to understand what it might take for leaders in government to unite and direct us. We put our hope in others, none intending to do any such thing. We don't need to understand them and what they are doing. They need to understand us. We didn't create our government so they could lead us along as they please. We created our government to be run by each state as they saw fit by people who lived there and were visible members of their communities. Through Judicial Review and  Congressional Implied Powers, we allowed our government to run us rather than work for us. So to find a way to get people , who believe they are there to decide for us ,to relinquish the fiefdoms and thrones they've carved out for themselves is a fantasy. And completely unnecessary.  We need merely to dismiss them. They are OURS. Or not. The privilege is bestowed by US. We are not SUBJECTS. My efforts, in earnest, are designed to bring remembrance, and to inspire, not to direct or decide. We get the carts back behind the horses, and we'll be able to get along, once again, right nicely. And the news will, once again, trumpet our advances as it lays bare our flaws, openly, for all to see. You know what they do with crippled horses....so dismissal is quite kind, no....? I'll stay in touch, Windy, as we move forward.....and, thank you fellow patriot, as well....
Good morning, All!
Good Morning Redfox and to all of you country loving Patriots. 
Good morning all OK brothers and sisters!
Good morning sir
Wow ho Fd up can it get!
And Good morning to you sir
A lot of crazy crap to read through from yesterday. 
Yes I was looking it over. Looks like some stuff for me to listen too while driving 
Hey you are into antennas for radios, I have an old satellite dish not in use on the roof. What do you think, if anything, I could do with it?
Radio wise
Yes, I was offline yesterday after we spoke last. Went to bed very early. Head ache and body ache from my 2nd vax caught up to me.
Feeling better so far but I haven't moved from my pillow yet.
Damn hope you feel better. They say that lasts a few days
Like the flue without the congestion. 
I just hope you will be ok long term. I really do hope what they are saying about this vaccine being bad 3-12 months down the road are not true
Both my parents and step parents got the vaccine
That all was my reservation in getting it at first. My wife and I had planned on waiting one year but that quickly changed for her. Then I got sucked into it. Well as they say you can't live forever.
I know but as fighter pilots are always saying, extend the fight!
It would be really fucked up if we all turned into zombies like on the living dead, lol
I hope it works out I do
Then someone would have to shoot you in the head 
Or chop it off
Or smash it with a bat
Just fire up all of the wood chippers and toss us in
There ya go mass de production lol
I am more bothered by all the bs hysteria over this thjng
True. It was all blown way out of proportion. 
I cannot talk with my mom about it it gets heated
She‚Äôs fucking scared over nothing and won‚Äôt see it
Did you see that Minneapolis has come out with new rules for white people. Here we fucking go, race wars a comming. Just what the commies want.
Yes saw that. Unreal! I think now we need to nuke Portland and Minneapolis from orbit like KAZ is sayjng
Your mom like many have been brainwashed by the BS. It's not their fault though it is sad.
And yes obliteration 
Yes she keeps watching CNN....argh! Haven‚Äôt watch them with any intention since my last deployment. It was sitting there watching the AFN news channel cycle through them all I started to realize the bs 
And I am not an anti vaxxer by any stretch. My kids got all their shots, I took everything the AF gave more so then some people get. This one just rubs me the wrong way
MSM BS Brainwashing 
Yes propaganda bs
Just sit there and tell me what happened that‚Äôs it keep your opinion out of it
Do your job!
Same here. I just gave in to keep what little piece there is in our home in tact 
I hear ya. We at least agree on not getting it or letting the kids get it
Her ex the kids‚Äô dad got his shots
If I start to grow a third arm or better yet a second penis, well I'll try to make the most of it until someone has to shoot me in the head!
So what do you think I can do with that satellite dish on my roof radio wise?
Hmm. The eurociro is into microwave transmission. He hasn't been on much lately though. 
I was thinking that too. Wonder if he is moving finally and has packed up everything.
It's Chiroeurope
Yeah I knew what you meant
No he's been busy back at backs 
Whatever I could do with it would be a SHTF deal
I think they make good cooking devices.  
Lol well good to know 
You paint the surface with a reflective coating, polish it and it directs the suns rays to cook food
Can't get any more SHTF than that
For now I would focus on traditional radio setups. I got my 50 watt GMRS in for my truck yesterday. Get your vehicles outfitted and your camp
Yeah I am was just thinking of down the road it might have a use. It‚Äôs way up at the highest point of the house of course so reaching it would be impossible since I don‚Äôt have a ladder that tall.
Believe me no one is better at getting side tracked with ideas than I. We need to keep each other on track 
Gotcha that was the whole idea keep on track 
I found a new vertical antenna design yesterday. It pushes a coiled up real of copper-barylium tape up the inside of the antenna core to specific lengths all counted out digitally for different frequencies. It's way too easy to focus on things that, A. We can't afford or B. We don't need. 
Still it fascinates me but I should be studying for my HAM licenses 
Lol yes focus! I agree with you. Gonna order my study guides this weekend
Good morning, But I'm not really awake yet :slight_smile:
Krissy, you might be a country girl, with an appreciation for clarity, but you are by no stretch of the imagination simple. As we have both mentioned, there are many patriots, and the patriots are beginning to form groups calling for action. I have ineptly tried as much. Torches and Pitchforks 2016 at the state capitol of Cheyenne Wyoming, and the Declaration of Independence 2020 at Michigan's capitol in Lansing as well. The former about taking our government back with 10th Amendment states rights, which by design were meant to be used to govern locally, rather than a large, distant, and obtrusive federal government deciding for all. The latter a list of 14 grievances, of which the stolen election can now be added, all unconstitutional. Both on Independence Day, July 4th, to strike a patriotic note of remembrance. Picnics, rest and relation won out on both occasions. After being in Lansing again on Jan.6 with my Oath Keeper outfit at the time, there to witness the call for insurrection that never took place, since Trump never gave it, my focus changed. While those around me, already cloaked in secrecy which I never once entertained, and set on patiently digging deeper into obscurity, to doomsday prep, I was relieved of my command. Joining to help build a national voice, and presence, I apparently became too outspoken as the focus shifted to hiding, as I saw it, in the aftermath of the D.C. charade, a presentation made to present patriots as terrorists. I was actually asked if I could tow the line, and knew I couldn't and wouldn't, so I relinquished my role so I wouldn't rock a really good boat, while I found another one, or made my own. Tenth Amendment rallies  and prayer marches, attended in both Lansing, and D.C. ( The Return ) along with every other effort, made look at it all objectively. Mere appeal, or lip service, at best, was all I saw. Along with the knowledge there are obviously millions of people who feel as I do. People think, feel, and then act. The left has acted. The conservatives remain planted on some imaginary higher ground. It doesn't exist, especially if it isn't recognizable, nor recognized, which it isn't..Action is needed. Many lines have been crossed. Push back is inevitable. Never met a hunter who brought home some game he didn't make the time and preparations to go out and collect. Goal oriented. The game, location, season, wherewithal, brought to bear with effort. To be results oriented, and all adults endeavor to perfect their way of living , goals must be determined, to be met. What is ours...? Do we grab the bull by the horns, or let it jump around kicking everyone in the face.....Integrity. Then responsibility. One does not exist without the other. Those of us who are greatly offended have shared our thoughts with each other. Even voiced them, to be heard by all.  My mother used to call to me by my first name. If unanswered, then much louder by my full name. Still unanswered, she smacked the living shit out of me. Results oriented, my mother..... Have a great day, tonight our collaborative efforts will produce the material I'll use to fashion my call out....until then.... and I kept your number, and look forward to calling you, and you will have mine. Your thoughts as I launch are already considered valuable....

_"Meta-analyses based on 18 randomized controlled treatment trials of ivermectin in COVID-19 have found large, statistically significant reductions in mortality, time to clinical recovery, and time to viral clearance. Furthermore, results from numerous controlled prophylaxis trials report significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID-19 with the regular use of ivermectin. Finally, the many examples of ivermectin distribution campaigns leading to rapid population-wide decreases in morbidity and mortality indicate that an oral agent effective in all phases of COVID-19 has been identified."_

Jesus said to her, ‚Äú[Dear] woman, what is that to you and to Me? My time [to act and to be revealed] has not yet come.‚Äù
JOHN 2:4 AMP
https://bible.com/bible/1588/jhn.2.4.AMP
O//
The amplified Bible adds "Dear" to imply reverence towards his mum.  I suspect the perfection of Jesus meant you could only take this vs in that light.  Even as a child he must have never disrespected her.
A//
I have always tried to respect my mom through all her Anti-Christ Jesus debating, and this verse encourages me.  
P//
Help me oh Lord to continue to love, honor and respect my mother.  Let her see you through my actions. Amen.

It is so good to hear from you! I know you must be swamped with new duties there in Arizona. I am still in Colorado, but will leave on Sunday for the drive to Panama City, to assume a more active role in unifying our Southern command. I am always at your service, whatever/whenever you need. As I move to dedicate my life to our cause, please continue to pray for me, that I will have the strength and wisdom to do what is right and stand strong to the end.

Keep reminding me!
if you commit to reading your bible daily, all will drop away
the veil will be removed
just read a chapter
do proverbs to start
I will, and will keep reading
Solomon's wisdom is the bst
then go back to Pslams
read Davids pain
You're right there

You're a warrior
That's what warriors do
you don't understand what that is
Please tell me
i'm not good
ive killed women, children
im not good
Why do you keep saying that, when you are reborn in the Blood of Christ. God forgives. You know that. But you must now accept that and forgive yourself
I got dumped into it, but im not good
I kept doing it
I knew better
Can you forgive yourself now, for me?
still working on it
but thats mine
It's hard
ive stayed single for these reasons
I fight this all the time_
I understand, thank you. Why do you feel drawn to me?
your a Godly woman
your depth
I just trust my heart
and your wicked long legs and pretty as
Well, now we're getting somewhere...lol
You are so much like me
I think so
I do need some work
Join the club
There but for the grace of God, go I
squaring with the things I've done, and where I am changing
I don't love right always
It's not supposed to be easy, but its not impossible
I get angered
im not violent
but I am
I didn't think so, just damn good at self-defense
I love violence
Its a human trait
no, I actually enjoy it
Okay, which one is it?
Love or hate?
You're pretty deep yourself, beloved
I enjoy our enamines dead
There's certainly a lot of them! Personally, I'm glad you got them, before they got to me
there are cultures that were better at this
Such as?
I doubt there has ever been a better man than you. Some things we have no control over, and are a mystery
I can't explain this on chat
No problem

Not too bad just normal things to do around the house kids to take care of. Weather is looking to be good that‚Äôs a good thing. How about yours?
pretty good, gonna finish things in the home and take out some rifles for zeroing later today
I am jealous!
got to get out before it gets hot here in AZ
its already 90sish now
Yes that‚Äôs a hot alright. My folks and brother live out there. Know it well
I wear 3 per and OK here openly and get high fives and salutes from cops
we dont have to live quiet here
I routinely pull security with police here
I drive around in my truck and work van with an OK sticker affixed 
they take lead, I just back them
That‚Äôs good keeps up relations with brothers in blue
well, most know me well
and I teach and train here
they know whats up
phoenix is a different animal
we have dems here that are on the right side of things, they dont know they are getting used yet
loads of vets of color and cops
My folks live in that area so I can believe it
just dont quite see it yet
tried to tell loads of folks in here about the soft kills
youve seen my words
Yes I have
some won't ever listen
like with the VAC
My folks would be among that crowd unfortunately 
had a horrible blow out with my folks
We have had discussions that got a bit heated as we have in the past but that‚Äôs mostly with stepdad
you know whats worse bro
My dad here in NC is on our side
I can stick around, or what them go
Yeah that sucks 
honestly, I'm probably gonna move back to the south
at least I'll find other trigger pullers and more of an OK presence
We need more of us here most are in hiding. Not all of us but a lot 
In this part anyway
where are you
I was thinking carolinas
N GA
I have people there
Crime is nuts right now
other vets
Shootings every day
hell thats nothing, try the southern border
I know it‚Äôs really bad down there 
A 7 year old got hit a few weeks ago in a spray and pray drive by
I dont move toward texas or mexico without full kit
I got hit last night
But you‚Äôve been there and done that so makes sense
What happened
short or long story?
Lol go for it 
I making coffee so all good and ready
Good morning Oath Keepers. 
so a friend of mine who is hispanic and  I, got targeted by darker gents
Good morning ssgtgman 
Morning to you DaveyE7 
my friend is female and a vet as well
one of the biggest darker gents Ive ever seen jumped out of his Escalade, decided  I was an issue of color
Oh did he
looked up, saw my Vet plates and tabs on my truck
came at me and my friend
my friend jumped in and told him off, I went to my ankle 45 xds
he left quick
Springfield XD series my fav
he was running his mouth about cops and feds
went quiet quick
madmarine4212, may I ask what city this took place in? And do you believe the race war is on?
Good shouldn‚Äôt be running his mouth anyway. Ssgtgman he‚Äôs in Phoenix area
yeah I do believe they will use race
Read a few article this morning about attacks on whites
been really effective so far
By black mobs fucking sad and stupid
first ive seen it
this dude wanted me over race, never seen it before
he only backed up over my EGA,Ranger,Airbourne decals
and vet plates
I know that the commy left have been pushing for this to stir up shit and then implement more control over us. Unfortunately I to think it's inevitable with recent events. 
ive been in thousands of gun fights,
dude wanted a fight
he called me out on being white
Think he did so because you where with your Hispanic friend?
That‚Äôs where I thought you where going when you said that. 
Suck bs
shes a patriot and vet too
I dealt with that crap with the kids I taught in JROTC all day every day. Brought that neighborhood bs with them to achool
Good we need her
cant say what she said about him here
n word
Probably some Spanish words mixed in too
but she said it in mex/american
cant say it here
Started with B & ended with O!
ya'll can imagine
Yes sir!
some P's and M's too
loads of vals from a Christian girl
Shit sticks, I'm going to have to convince my wife to start carrying! 
yeah brothers
Carry every day 
All day
I went for chex mix and a six pack
it could have gone so bad
now, I had cameras
I would have been clean
, but in this day and age?
She's been hesitant. Doesn't think she needs it plus she worked in Logan Airport for a long time and couldn't obviously be carrying in there.
my friend would have backed me
110 perent
she was a medic in comabt
combat, we've known each other for years
she has a CAB
Nice yeah she would have backed you up no problem
she did
got in his face
Can‚Äôt carry near an airport these days although if I pick someone up I do
I was going for my ankle 45
girl is a lioness
That‚Äôs what these idiots on the left need to remember there are too many recent combat vets around that don‚Äôt want to hear that bs
yeah, true
Some are laying low right now but I am sure would come out if it got that bad which it‚Äôs going that way
dude came real close to lead poisoning last night
hornady style
He would have deserved it
He initiated it
I knew, he looked at backed down
ya'll need to be careful
I think this shit is gonna be on the reg soon
I ride around with 3 per and OK tabs, and my military tabs on my personal Vech's
I think you are too right 
be careful
arm up brothers and sisters
be careful
dont hide what you are
When we went to TN last weekend had my carry and spare mags plus another weapon packed and spare mags
No way
a SEAL friend of mine, who just retired, told me I was brave for showing our''colors''
I DONT GIVE A FUCK
out of fucks to give
Well I have a damn neighbor who is flying a BLM flag loud and proud. So they can kiss my ass
OK sticker on my truck 
I really dont care
madmarine4212, I appreciate you sharing this! This was enough to convince my wife to take it from the BR to the glove box. It's a start.
we need too
hey if you want training
come to me
wont charge anyone in OK a dime
Would if we weren't so far. Sig is just 50 miles north. They have lots of classes for her.
yeah, but i
'm one of the most dangerous men alive brother
airfare and bring me 500 rds
Then it's a good thing we have you!
that you will shoot on my ranges
sure brother, we need us all
Ssgtgman what‚Äôs the law in MA for carrying on glove box? Legal?
Yes we can‚Äôt lose anyone of us
I know you guys know how to push an objective
nothing like the master at arms\
gung ho
It needs to be more secure than that. I'll be buying her a lock box. She has her LTC. So could be on a magnet it's the leaving it in the car part when she goes into a place where it needs to be secured proper 
get her a good carry bag
She should carry on her person more secure 
takes training gents, you know that
And practice
500 rds
is my personal cut off /with h2h
I need to convince her to carry. But we still need a proper lock box for when she goes where it's not allowed. 
Western north carolina checkin in........madmarine..we as well open carry here and i fly them. OK colors loud....fuck em..feed em fried fish eggs...up against the wall with handcuffs on...fuck em!!!!
Agreed WKNC!
WKNC, Semper Fi
gung ho
Do or die....spittin my guts..blood in their  eyes
brass on the floor brother
or blood on our risers for us airborne folks
Just interviewed someone from Ladson for my company not too long ago
seriously, tell your women, or men, shit is gonna heat up
I can send you a recommendation on a lock box for your wife
Brother im in waist deep..wadin deeper......
i work in this everyday
One I found that I use when I travel small light lockable also descrete 
I teach military and cops
this is the third time I was near using a weapon
have it be ready
Amen to that 
It is..has been
Imagine what LE does everyday
I live in a place where it happens
I  had a time where I didn't have wear it, thats over
I can‚Äôt remember a time when I wasn‚Äôt carrying anymore. Been a long time for that 
Imagine if I had my daughter or son
Let me go look what the name is and try and send a pic.
Small enough to hide under the seat and blend in
Kills me that I lost my 2A rights from a no accident DUI 25 years ago.
they are grown, they dont have my skill set as a Ranger or Marine
all of that Infantry and Spec Ops
I know. I wonder if you can get the VA non resident permit?
But I want her projected. If it happens we'll go broke covering her in court but at least she'll still be here. 
That‚Äôs what my fianc√©e has now she just took her NC class and is doing her paperwork
they would have been beaten or worse
CCW safe offers military a good coverage plan for $149 a year and an extra $100 cover spouses as well
That‚Äôs what we have
I think the Feds adopted the law on DUI vs gun buys
That's well worth it
Of course MA comes up red as in not good on almost all concealed carry issues or permits 
It is
I will look it up and send a link
I couldnt live that as a man and as a Vet
no way
Oh on the CCW coverage? 
Gotta get my boys up then go get a stupid Covid test
My autistic sons therapist came down with the Covid so he had to get tested yesterday because he has his well baby check next week. I have to get tested to be able to go back to work 
My fianc√©e had a low fever yesterday and they still let her go to work today at the hospital 
No test
Oh, might be what you all were going through. 
Any loss of taste?
Maybe but I feel better
So does she
Fingers Xd
He tested negative yesterday
windy, today, May 1st, I will announce the campaign to get the attention of government actors, the media, and patriots alike. My prayers will be with you in your efforts. There are many whose efforts are focused on bringing the ignorant up to snuff, and many who feel preparing for the aftermath of what surely appears to be certain calamity of gargantuan proportions is the more prudent course. As fellow Oath Keeper lonestarhog stated to me, let him who is prescient make his presence known....? I believe, like all the efforts of the destroyers, those of us seeking to protect and defend are weighing in, in 
 as many ways, if not more. The Resistance of the left, meeting The Rebellion of the right, was destined to lead to The Confrontation, center stage, in the middle of the road, the middle of the day, for all to see. The Genie is out of the bottle. Of the many whose efforts I spoke of, those of the sane, you, windy, like I, and some others, realize what no turning back means.Because we already live there. In our hearts, and our minds. I have been wrong any number of times in my life, in a number of ways, for a number of reasons. And when confronted with the messes I made, or found myself in, I was able to pull through and overcome by simply believing one thing about myself. I always believed I was trying to do good, what was right, for myself, and others. Before God, honesty is all we have. Integrity and responsibility must go hand in hand. Humility is not new to me. It refreshes you. And denial makes that fresh start impossible. We are ready for that fresh start, others not so much. Time is often terrible,  yet nearly as much, it can be a wondrous thing. Remember that game, Hide and Seek....? Before you looked for the next person to be "it", you called out " Ready or not, here I come!"  Have a great day, I'll holler at you later after I flesh the final things out.....
You'll be good
Rapid test I get mine at 1040 today
Yeah I am not concerned. Told my mom and of course gotta hear it from her! Argh!!!
Oh boy.
Yes said I should get the shot and be done with it, said ha! No way. Then my stepdad says I am putting others at risk. I stopped talking just shook my head 
How am I risking anyone when I am not sick and they are vaccinated? 
you guys, are great
Whatever such bs
the life blood
No brother you are great
no, I love freedom
same as you bro
Well not to take away the GREATNESS of my fellow OKs
long live theses United States!
People want to take away, we want to give back
proud to know you all
It's all BS brother 
not a shitbird here
And proud to be a part of keeping America strong and true
from another NCO, Ooorah
Ooorah brother
nothing like that blood stripe
earned it
I'll bet!
I was a wrench. In charge of the allied trades shop, recovery, up-armoring, etc. Never got ambushed on recoveries in Iraq. Worst that happened was some of my nine shitbags tried to take me out with acetylene OX bombs set behind me while I was welding. Blew the metal roof off of the warehouse we were setup in.
hey, you kept grunts and operators aline
just like me
one team,  one fight
it takes all of us
I know just irritating is all
There were some hispanic gang members in my section. They didn't want to work and didn't appreciate my boot in their asses.
ive seen that, doesnt matter
im brown,ish
doesnt matter
move past and drive on
My command was afraid of them though. I had two separate incidents where E5s started fist fights with me and all was swept. F-ing sad unit.
the only colors I care about red,white,and blue
All behind me though I have trust issues still
The fighter pilots I took care of got reminded of that every time there was an ejection especially the one we had over Iraq. They treated us a little differently after that. One team one fight. All of us have different skill sets but all have one thing in common, a desire to give back defend what our brothers and sisters died for. 
Only colors that matter 
red.white,and blue
I never had an issue with the operators when I was in AFSOC
get over that shit
you bleed green
light green
or dark green
They didn‚Äôt realize a boot up their ass was fucking helpful
you are green
you took the oath, that why we are here
I liked the old all green when I was doing my first six in the early 80s
your green
get over it
its just green
different shades
I didnt see a marine
or soldier
I saw another man
we'd fight together, bleed together
I had a Hispanic student when I was teaching asked me who I would want in a fox hole with me, a beaner or a black kid. His words.... after carefully putting down whatever I had in hand so I didn‚Äôt smack him with it, I said whoever is shooting back in the correct direction and practicing good marksmanship! That shit doesn‚Äôt matter! The room when silent
and help each other, thats what brothers do
They learn that crap in their neighborhoods 
Brought with to school instead of trying to make something of themselves 
And that shit is getting worse fast
And yes mm4212 that‚Äôs what we do fight together period, 
but that is what the corps is here for
I love marines, I struggle to love you people
Well my brothers, I have a yard of loom to wheelbarrow from my truck into the backyard. Then mount my new GMRS in the cab. 
Good talk, my war brothers 
and you dont make it easy
Enjoy that loom ssgtgman!
And have with that radio let me know how it goes
I will. Gotta get into it like a mission. 
Absolutely stay focused
That reminds me. GMRS license today to
I could take SSGT and Davey
and make a rifle plt
Got your 6 mm4212
Signing out
Yut yut
And any OKer in any situation
all the way
Cause it‚Äôs gonna come to that point 
Rangers lead the way
As they should. I know my place just know I always have any brothers back
I know you do
Did some crazy shit when I was hospital security too. Down town Charlotte 
yeah,  I know bro
I talk with leadership
I know your worth, no sweat
It‚Äôs what‚Äôs in a mans heart that matters most sometimes. Will to live trumps almost all is what SERE taught me
I agree
Wish I had payed better attention back then but 18 young and stupid
yeah,we all felt that way then
shit happens
Yep so damn true. Can‚Äôt get that across to anyone now just like we didn‚Äôt get it either. Shit always happens!
jones locker
got some bones, afew frogies on my chest
Just glad you are on our side need more like you and more period
i think so, its gonna get worse
No doubt
no seems to want to see that
Crime going up all over shows they are emboldened
keep you fins close

I supported the teams and the aircraft that delivered them
yeah, your clean, I can tell you dive

Good morning Patriots!

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Wasn‚Äôt with AFSOC too long mostly supported fighter aircraft but learned a lot in that short time. Mission focus was everything in that world as it should be
Good morning Ron

Good news we have a member in your county.
Good morning Ron
Full schedule today, will check in as I am able.
Same here gotta get started shortly

I believe that no doubt 
we dont even hear about it
most seals do it
they are even still terrified
i dont mind diving, but I hate depth
when you talk about heroes
those fucks, are the real deal
I think the public should be thankful they don‚Äôt hear some of that stuff
It‚Äôs not video game shit
when they talked about the deep blue sea
they werent fucking around
you were a grunt
Grunt and get it done
NAV right?

For years I have been attempting to explain to people about the Act of 1871.  Monkey has done a pretty good job of explaining - minus some grammar/spelling errors, like Capital instead of Capitol.  Attempting to get people to quietly sit, listen, and ask questions is virtually impossible.  Frustrating!

Sounds like some good news for once! The allegations were a total ruse, from start to finish. We are seeing the greatest attacks on human rights that we've ever witnessed in our country (that is, when our globalalist Marxist rulers allow us a peak at the truth)

I'm due for a trip to REI, if that's okay with you. Possibly tomorrow, but if not, next Saturday sounds like a good day.
Why not?
I switched over to my laptop and the same thing. So I just sent it. There's a line that says signature and under it spell the name of the authorized signatory. Maybe it's not meant to be signed? The other thing is they still have the fee listed as $70 bucks. Supposed to have dropped to $35 for the 10 year license. I guess we'll see if it all goes through. 
The final choice is upon us. When we'come to the end of the rainbow, do we really need any more signs? @ssgtgman @madmarine4212 @wildman1959  #FL

Not On Our Watch
I had no doubt about it :pray:
Some day my brother. Is your fiance locked into a career there to?
Or I think you said it was more her mom being there?
No it‚Äôs her ex and her kids. He won‚Äôt leave his house even though he is in such a crappy neighborhood. I won‚Äôt let her go alone to his house if I can help it. Her daughter put up a fuss when I tried to move us last year but it can‚Äôt last forever
Her mom and bf are in TX right now with their RV 
How old are her kids
They come and go as they please
Daughter just turned 13, son with special needs is 11 will be 12
Did you get a confirmation email from the FCC for your license?
Meant to ask earlier 
Ya that's a tough age for separation from the area. You want my Motor home
Lol I wish

Down sizing to a trailer. That's why I bought the diesel Ram 3500
I am going to convince her that by the end of the year we need to start looking and get out of dodge. Hopefully it won‚Äôt be too late
Even just over into SC would be good way better
Who knows with the race shit coming on maybe he won't make it much longer in that neighborhood 
Cut you both some real slack
It‚Äôs pretty mixed but just so crappy. Anything inside the 485 loop here in Charlotte is bad and gets worse as you move farther inward
I even offered to look at homes he could live in with us and we could share the mortgage. He put a stop to that. The daughter was ok with it but not him. He wants to finish up and retire at the hospital we all worked at together and then move.

doesn't seem to be getting better anywhere, expect it will go full tilt chaos sooner rather than later! i kept hearing Trump was 'overseeing' some big SO but its starting to look like he walked away from his post as CIC after this country was outright attacked, both from foreign assets as well as domestic - i keep thinking what the UCMJ says about that??
@denbo I agree, not good at all. Personally, I myself have serious questions in this regard. And while I cannot be the one to judge him, the reality is, we will ALl soon be called to account for our actions (or failure to fulfill our actions (or failures to act) since 3.11.20.  But the bottom line is, as citizens who wish to remain free, we can't afford to wait for Trump to reveal his "secret plan" if he even has one beyond improving his golf game and competing in the social media space (which, call me a heretic if you will) but I seriously doubt it. We patriots--you and I--will have to take back America ourselves, and the sooner the better.
agree windy... 'FOR THE GRANDKIDS... mine & everyone else'... timing on our 'movement' will be critical - too soon & OOPS!.. too late & an even BIGGER OOPS!!!

@lonestarhog We love you brother. and definitely need the optimist's angle. There is hope as long as 2A doesn't fall :slight_smile:
Yes we need that optimism! Again I try and maintain hope for a non kinetic solution, hoping like hell the people will wake up and say enough is enough. We see it happening in small groups now but can it last and spread. God willing it will

~windy
I have a couple of questions for you, brothers and sisters. Our Constitution has been subverted and we have been losing ground for 15 months straight. How will we know when it is too soon or too late? If not now, when? What is OUR Red Line in the sand? When they start kicking in our doors,  seizing our weapons and taking us to "re-education" camps? When our children and grandchildren begin dying off from the vaccine.  When HHS Secretary Bill Gates blots out the sun? When the Rapture arrives? When is it time for talk to become action? Red Dawn has arrived.
:church: I know this is preaching to the choir when saying:  Most people, whether they admit it or not, are 'followers'.  Throughout history it has been shown that when a certain percentage (approximately 13% some argue) of people move in a particular direction, the herd will slowly, at first, start to follow, and it will eventually become a stampede.  This is occurring, especially through the dissemination of viral videos.  The real enemy of the Commies.

Also, remember that only 3% of the Colonists took part in The American Revolution; therefore, The Three Percenters.

Lol too funny
The fat lady hasn't sung. Joining a number of other movements, I am pleased to announce the start of another: THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT is the  name, the slogan, the message, and the truth. Starting today, I' will be encouraging others on any number of sites to join in open acknowledgement of the fact that government actors and the media have participated in overthrowing a duly elected president. After 4 years of zero support, negative attitudes, bogus investigations leading to an unconstitutional impeachment proceeding all members of Congress participated in, enough is enough .A pandemic ,politicized to further demonize an incumbent with enormous support and weaponize through an illegitimate election process a sitting government, including its judiciary,all bent on implementing further control which can never be challenged, is the last straw. Our government has selected itself. That, my friends, is unconstitutional. As of Monday, a form letter that can be read as an inspiration, and most certainly as a ringing indictment, will be posted on this site, and others. But better still, it will be sent via email to the military, law enforcement, local, state, and federal representatives, both legislative and judicial.. THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT is a FACT. And without a leg to stand on, 18 million veterans, oath keepers one and all, and tens of millions of patriots from all walks of life must rally to replace them. Their coup was the only insurrection this nation witnessed. Replacing these tyrants is our Constitutional duty. Government isn't dangerous, and neither are guns. People are dangerous. And dangerous people must be dealt with. While we are able, let's see that we do. You cannot forgive what has not been rectified.
This is the kind of stuff I got banned from Facebook for!

RIGHT ON @wildman1959 Outstanding analysis, sir! Definitely the more the merrier. Perhaps we'll even get the real CIC to join us? Time for us to unite the tribes and bring it all together for a (hopefully) peaceful conclusion! The longer we wait, the less chance its going to be peaceful. We need a far more aggressive outreach to our hard-core AND TPC (Trans-Political Community) brothers and sisters, who can be swayed to a more robust and forward-edging stance.

I believe there are, and will be, many. Stewart Rhodes. Richard Mack. We have many capable leaders, more than I could name. And we will join them and support their efforts to remove the wicked and replace the corrupt as we renew what government we both need and want, with Constitutional instruction , and clarity. Like never before. There is a name tag and a price tag on every square inch of the Earth. The only frontier left to explore is ourselves and each other. You can't open your mind until you open your heart. Therein lies a limitless realm of possibility. New wine in a new wine skin, not an old one. When a man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things pass away, and all things become new. Integrity is nice, responsibility better, for without responsibility, integrity would not exist. The limitations that restrain, we created. So I will not point to one, merely join them. Since they are among us, as we arise, so will they. THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT is as much an invitation as an indictment.How it strikes your fancy, is how it will be. Thanks for asking. We'll see!
I'm in the Village of Oak Creek, just south of Sedona.  I'm not a native, so I don't think of myself as being "from" here, but it's where I'm at now.
#PA #FL @wildman1959  Check it out guys! A very empowering interview with a young Pennsylvania patriot, Andy Walker, a true working class man of the people running as a Republican for PA Borough Council. I don't know about his chances, but he seems to me me to be the real deal, and the kind of candidate we need to get behind. While most of you are aware of my strong skepticism that further elections are futile under the current situation (which Andy touches on here also), this video makes the case that broad-based conservative political leadership is yet possible, given the right circumstances. He also sheds critical light on the momentous challenges we face in the purely political arena, from the refreshingly honest, NON-COMMIE/NON-RINO perspective we are so in need of seeing more of. Andy's Facebook page below, and you can email him at:  andy4office@gmail.com

#PA #FL @wildman1959 We gotta get this guy off of Facebook (which most conservatives have been banned from) and on to Gab! But until then....

Good morning
If only there was such a thing as moral high ground. I simply believe the only way integrity exists is because of responsibility, or it would not exist. With the only two peoples being adults and children, in my estimation, what we do reflects what we are, not what we think or say. We'll catch up. Thanks.
Good my fellow Patriots

Awesome guy! He is correct in his analogy of pulling a weed, he left the three interviewers speechless! He repeats the same type of things SR is always saying, grassroots organizing at the local level. As an organization I think OK needs to find more like this guy and help as we can so we can pull the weed and root OUT and really stop refilling the DC swamp

Hog :cowboy:
Ok, I am not very good at getting on here. I have contacted everyone who pm'd me and gave information on some training. The people training are not a militia group, just people trying to stay prepared. Usually the training will be posted a few days before the event, with little notice. There is a reason for this, and that being trying to keep it low key to not get too much attention. I was in the Black Horse militia for a few years and now that group is no longer but, most of the people that go to the training were from that group. All groups are small in Washington. Most groups have from 20 to 50 members. Oath Keeper are weak here and we all know it, as everyone here is looking for something that is not here as I only see 5. The only way we can get anything done is to get together with all groups, and create willing numbers of participants.
Safe places are just one piece of the puzzle. Things went wrong as soon as we gave rights to kids under 18. Back in the day you did what you were told or were punished, back in the day you did not disrespect adults or you were punished, and the list goes on, today, they have adult rights but cant manage them properly.
:skull_crossbones: The Nuremberg Code of 1947

This should be enforced since it is not an FDA Approved vaccine; rather an "experimental".....

Hog :cowboy:
:thumbsup: Agree.  Also, it started in the late 70s and early 80s with shows that demeaned adult authorities, like fathers and school principals.  Both were portrayed as bumbling idiots and the children/students were so wise and manipulative.

Hog :cowboy:
Lets shoot for next Saturday. I will contact you later this week.
Leaders of church are weak. A lot of Minute men who helped lead the revolution were leaders of churches. What are you getting today from them? Don't go to church and exercise your rights given to you by God to gather and pray. I believe in God and pray to him, but will not follow someone who just reads a book and tells you to pray and everything will be fine...What a load of c@*p. God gave us a mind and body that we each are in control of. My thoughts are that churches need to stop talking the talk and start walking the walk. Take a stand for our God given rights without compromise. ;)
You need any more info, I can get you there. ;)
By the way, I am in So King Co...Pacific (Auburn)
OK Ill check it out.
I am really close to you.
We have 4 to 6 guys but spread out in the south sound.
Yes this experimental bs needs to go away. First we don‚Äôt need a vaccine that has a treatment, second get truly verifiable safe approval then maybe we can talk. But since none of this is about that well we know how far that will go. Nazis did experiments too....just saying 
Lets do next Saturday. Got things planned for today. I will contact you later this week.
Chat acting strange
Like to meet up sometime.
We can meet at my place if you want? Lets put something together! I am pretty open. :)
I would dare say leaders at many levels of many different entities are weak. Not all but enough to cause chaos. Parenting is also leadership and that is weak in a lot of cases. I always speak of having an overbearing Italian mom who rode my ass about everything, but it made me who I am and I am thankful for it. My stepdaughter was a pain in my butt all while she was growing up, I had to ride her ass as my mom did mine, but now she has acknowledged it was the right thing to do
:confounded: I dunno know...Is it just me?

I unsubscribed from the Trump Campaign for text messages.  So many texts were sent telling me that President Trump was doing this-n-that, and had "personally selected" me to join him at...The main objective for "at" was to request money.

Now, maybe it is just me, but I expect President Trump's campaign to not insult the intelligence of his supporters with this type of psychological :poop: . I had complained/informed them about this concern, but like everything else, it fell on deaf :ear: :ear: .

Maybe I am just gettin' too crotchety.

:wave: :sunglasses: Happy sunny Texas Sunday OK Brethren!!!
Naw Hog, you hit the nail on the head brother! i did the same thing, got tired of the same ole song & dance with the palms up jesture
What I'm watching right now...

...the price of silver (aka canary of the financial coal mine)
...executive orders criminalizing "domestic terrorists" i.e. patriotic Americans
...safety and freedom of Stewart Rhodes and OK leadership
...COVID "vaccination" passport proposal
...forced COVID "vaccination" of all students, K-12.
...forced COVID "vaccination" of active service members proposal
...COVID vaccine delayed side effects
...AZ audit
...Russia and Ukraine
...China and Taiwan
...Israel and Iran
...fed's declassification of UFO documents this June could be unsettling for many

Am watching other developments as well, but those won't likely come to fruition before the SHTF.
@Keeping.AZ Great assessment! Maybe all we can do is watch, keep prepping locally and pray for a miracle to save us. After all, God wins in the end :slight_smile:
:alien: KAZ, when I was in the seminary (1965), to start a spirited debate I posited that Christ was an Alien, and laid out a solid argument to support my thesis.

When you say, "fed's declassification of UFO documents this June could be unsettling for many", it reminds me of the many arguments presented by other students, especially the Priests, who had the most closed minds of all.

Anyways, I have to wonder how Christians might accept the realization that Aliens/UFOs are real, and how this really does not affect Biblical Scripture, nor the existence of God.

I have tested the strength of many Christians, for example, at Easter by asking why Easter Sunday varies from year-to-year.  They get very defensive, but it is out of ignorance, and somewhat hostile when it is explained.

The disclosure will be interesting.....

What a sad ending for a once great country
I guess we always knew this day would come
I'm resigned to it. You all have awakened me....lol I guess I'll just go to Panama City and become a street preacher. Try to save some souls for the Lord. Not the worst fate, right?
_I have to wonder how Christians might accept the realization that Aliens/UFOs are real, and how this really does not affect Biblical Scripture, nor the existence of God._   @lonestarhog 

Who knows what will and won't be revealed this June, true of false. I suspect intelligent life beyond Earth have been visiting and influencing our world for a long time.  Evidence is mounting. A "big reveal" could have a very unsettling effect on people of all faiths and no faith.  The military certainly, and rightfully, is concerned about technology we cannot match or defend against. 

I am Catholic. A rather orthodox Catholic. The existence of life beyond our solar system does not conflict with my world view.
Windy, could you stick around a little longer?
Hey just ordered my study guides for Technician and General HAM license
Why? What good is it?
Everyone in my country is folding to  communism
I'm just a old country girl trying to go down in glory
I'm not folding.
I know
There's a few of us
Not many
Where's the organized resistance. Even the French and British are kicking our asses with that
No, there are not many of us. But we will meet the enemy on the field nevertheless.
I want to stay in touch with you and a few others here that I know are ready for a fight
Otherwise, I've got all the skills I need to take at least a dozen of them with me, which will give me all the satisfaction I need. I'm focusing now on prayer and fasting
prayer and fasting
Keep my phone number and collect others. This forum will be deplatted when Biden criminalizes "domestic terrorism." The Left ALWAYS silences the opposition.
Hey Big DaveyE7. Yes got that done yesterday and washed out the bed of my truck. Today I replanted a tree from the spot we put it last year and rearranged some pavers. More to do on the pavers.
Good deal on the study guides. 
I found this HAM who has a YouTube channel, good stuff. 
He also license prep. I'll post below, might be good to listen while driving. The first is technicians the second is general.

Don‚Äôt lose hope, gang‚Äî the left wants us demoralized‚Äî- we‚Äôll have our bad days, but we‚Äôre still here, and we will hold the line.
@Redfox  is right. We stay the course. 

If you feel DISGRACED or HUMILIATED or COWARDLY for having to wait while a globalist, Marxist cabal successfully overthrows our great nation's government and consolidates more and more power by the day, you are not alone. I feel it too---I feel every damn ounce of disgrace, as the shadows of Arlington grave markers grow long watching. 

It is only by the grace of God, I humbly WAIT. There is a time and season for everything. Christians and Jews do not march out ahead of the Ark of the Covenant; we march BEHIND the Ark, the Covenant before our column. 

My commitment to punishing my enemies and restoring this great nation grows stronger with every lash Lady Liberty suffers. 

My patience is not unlimited.
Hey good deal. Yeah this is definitely worth listening too while driving. Thanks! Having some repairs done tomorrow that I can‚Äôt reach to do so was prepping the area upstairs for them to come first thing tomorrow. 
DITTO - KAZ!!!:flag_us: :eagle: .......... not sure if i said Howdy to all!!... sorry for my manners!:pray:
Redfox and Keeping.AZ are correct we must stay the course. They want us down and demoralized. If our POW‚Äôs in Vietnam could hang in for years so can we. We owe it to all who have come before us, made the ultimate sacrifice to stay strong! Remember they cannot take the Will that is inside all of us. That has been proven over and over! Never give up while you have the means to resist which you always have that inside you! God willing we will win the day and all will be right again!
Windy that‚Äôs not a bad idea but do not lose hope for that is what they want. Hang tough sister, hang tough!
I too worry for our leadership in OK but I am sure they have that on their mind as well. SR is always saying don‚Äôt hang up on 1 man, well if God forbid that were to happen it‚Äôs vital we are independently organized at the local level. We are many and strong just not all in here or members of OK... a sleeping giant will awaken one day and maybe sooner than we all think 
I agree. We do NOT hang our hopes on one man. I hang my hopes on our Heavenly Father and the great Patriot inside each and every freedom-loving, God-fearing man and woman. Men like you, Davey.

That being said, an organized resistance needs leaders.  And we'll need PLENTY of them.
@DaveyE7 I, for one, am not willing to live in America as a POW. Are you? At least our Vietnam POW's were captured in a foreign land, actually fighting the commies. We're surrendering to them on our own soil, without even a whimper! Its really stunning to watch.
I am with you on all of that my brother. Got yours and everyone‚Äôs 6 on this site
do NOT mistake 'silence' for 'surrender' windy... at least for many & likely ALL who reside here as OK brethren:flag_us:
Windy, there‚Äôs been no surrender. I, for one, am sure I shall soon lose my job and invite hell upon myself merely for being an OK. I say bring it. 
I do equate silence with surrender
Not all are surrendering. No one here right now, I sure as hell am not. Not until I am out of ammo and options which I intend not to be! And there are probably many many more who are silent now, but will speak up soon. I would bet it‚Äôs growing more every day
If not now, when?
i for one am 1 of the least qualified to claim the title of 'warrior' but rest assured i am NOT afraid to give my life to the cause... i know death personally... it's not so bad!
This has been going on for almost a year and half, folks! Its not going to get better until we do something about it
God will tell us that‚Äôs what I hear from my father each time I tell him I am losing faith and hope. The time will come and we will know it
The spark will be attempted seizure/confiscation of our firearms. Nobody‚Äî nobody‚Äî is taking my guns from me.
if anything... although nearly SOLO - i am @ defcon 1.5 - a fully equipped F.O.B. that can support a healthy fire-team long enough to make a little history!!:eagle: :flag_um:
Roger that, denbo.
they won't touch my neck of the woods w/o an MRAP fleet!! - we prepped for blue helmets here!
I doubt that will spark anything but mass compliance, just like everything else people are complying with now, as they regulate and tax guns and ammo out of existence over the next 3 years
 Not all will comply. I am not either. Period, that is my line in the sand
still buying ammo, prep food/water, silver, med supplies & assorted 'MIL-SPEC' goodies
Just happy to hear you all are so confident, and that its all going according to plan. I won't worry about it anymore :slight_smile:
IMO - exactly according to plan windy!:wink:
Faith is power!
I guess there was no need for me to be concerned. Its all good, right?
be vigilant & prepped for potholes instead... make strong thy Faith!:pray:
I have zero issues with my faith and resolve
figure of speech windy, not an accusation:wink:
I just tell it like it is

No I do not want to be a POW here in America to these morons. But if that is where I have be chosen to fight them, use my skills from 35 years of training and teaching and preparing for those situations, then so be it. They will not win, they will have me surrounded at that point the poor bastards!
I just want you to know that I am just your average white American Christian soccer mom, wondering when the hell is everyone gonna wake up!
Warrior is another favorite
That‚Äôs right. The cause is alive and well‚Äî- and, if anything, eachattack upon the Republic solidifies the resolve of the patriots.
Amen to that
'made a note'... i gotta wish you a happy mom's day next Sunday windy!:thumbsup: :grin:
Indeed it does. That which does not kill you, makes you stronger
The opening of Indestructible brought me back to Iraq it was that.....touching
Thank you for thinking of me there, Denbo! I just hope Mother's Day isn't the next American tradition to get cancelled as being racist...soon to be followed by us white mothers...lol
Hell No! Not canceling a damn thing and we haven‚Äôt. Family gatherings for us have gone on as planned over this last year. That‚Äôs proof we are not surrendering. 
@DaveyE7 Glad your existence hasn't been as devastated by the communist insurgency as it has mine. I guess your mileage may vary with this, depending on your individual situation. Colorado has surrendered, which is why I'm getting the hell out of here to a state that hasn't
So emotionally powerful
Windy ROCKS! We need many more like u!
Btw, if anyone is making contact w SR, please ask him to check out the Ohio chat room...
Thank you, sir, for the kind words! You made my day there. I do try my best. Must be that Girl Scout ethic taking over...lol
@stewart-rhodes @madmarine4212
Cool, are you having them take the sat disc down while they're up there? Turn that puppy into a solar oven ;^)
No I just did not comply. Most here in NC followed all of our idiot governors orders. I have had dirty looks and one lady said something to my fianc√©e. I have also worn the mask for work because I cannot get fired and I think mm4212 said it, gather intel, fake compliance to learn. Been doing that too. My job has also not shut down so we have been very fortunate but I see people‚Äôs support for all of this slowly going away. See more and more not complying. Either way I have not and will not surrender. Period
LOL no that‚Äôs staying out for now. May have a better use later but for now no more holes in the roof lol
All I must go for the evening. Feed kids and greet my fianc√©e. Stay the course, stay strong and remember Not On Our Watch!
Just checking out "A Reason To Fight" Cool!
Have a good night my brother 
I strongly agree with @Redfox that Charlie is just going to keep pissing regular folks like us off, to the point where we will have no choice go nuclear on them. In the meantime, I would just prefer us to be discussing a more proactive strategy, rather than daily losing ground, accepting massive casualties and waiting until 2024 to begin the process. We need to seriously up our game and move from a defensive to the offensive (with realistic battle plans for an unlimited asymmetrical counter-attacks, or we'll be lucky to make it out of 2021 with our skin. Hint, hint....
https://youtu.be/4pvsTgpIDT0
Indeed, Windy. Remember Wiston Churchill never lost because he never gave up.
I haven't told this part of my story to anyone for at least 30 years, but I will share it with you. directly from my heart:

My grandfather, a native Scotsman, James McNair, was WWII RAF Special Forces, died in aeriel combat over the skies of Germany in 1942 against the Lutwaffe, defending England during the Battle of Britain. He and his brethren heroes, leaving England victorious in 1945, but decimated, in total ruins, my grandmother and my 5 year-old mother homeless and fatherless. I was born to a USAF Korea/Vietnam/Cold War/Hard Core anti-communist patriot (E-7/4 combat tours/Bronze Star) from the hills of Tennessee 21 years later. His father was WWII US Army Infantry, Battle of the Bulge. 

This is the blood of men that runs in my veins and fuels my passion for defending liberty, and my first lessons in military science. We need to do much better than this. We have lost too much to let it all go now, for nothing :cry: @1jim2u @DaveyE7 @wildman1959 @madmarine4212 @ssgtgman
That‚Äôs amazing, Windy, thank you so much for sharing that. My parents escaped Cuba when Castro took over. They‚Äôve seen the movie currently playing in this country before. I was brought up understanding that the ‚Äúunimaginable‚Äù can, indeed, and does happen, quicker than anyone can imagine. When Sept 11th hit, I joined the USAFR as a flight surgeon, and put myself, personally, at risk for this country by doing whatever was asked of me. I believe in America, in our Republic. I am sure I‚Äôm on the radar, and that‚Äôs ok. 
Thank you so much @Redfox Your story bring brings tears--of both joy and sorrow--to my eyes. I salute you as a true American hero, Leader. physician-warrior, and honor the memory your brave anti-communist parents who gave your birth and raised you. *NEVER FORGET!* I am encouraged by your beautiful expressed continued commitment to the Republic, that she is yet in good hands with men like you defending her. That her blood sacrifices shall not have died vain It will be an honor to shake your hand and meet you on the battlefield for a final stand. And in some ways, I feel that I already have :heart:
Thanks, Windy, and thank u for ur courage. We need that. We need others to see that we‚Äôre committed. Ours will be a defensive strategy‚Äî- we shall be the resistance, and, as such, the hunted. It will take years of unrelenting attacks upon us. 
If such be the case, then I will have the honor of dying among the first wave of that party :slight_smile:
Let‚Äôs be ready for anything, and strive to survive
_Just happy to hear you all are so confident, and that its all going according to plan. I won't worry about it anymore_   @windy

Probably my final post here, my fellow Patriots-cheers from the crowd are heard...LOL To focus on getting my pretty rear-end down to #FL . From thence, next to thaw out and attempt to rally my good old Southern boys in prep the the next phase of the plan; that, and other reasons, specified in all my previous posts/comments above. I welcome anyone who wishes to connect with me in pure Agape' friendship to HMU @ krissyramsey@protonmail.com

Most importantly, I salute all of you OK patriots, as we continue with with this fight; all you who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces;, and all here who have family members who have paid the ultimate price for our freedom. With Memorial Day fast approaching, my :purple_heart: goes out tonight to the latter group, with tears of joy and sadness--for their sacrifices and for the two-plus centuries of freedom it has purchased us. You and I share a special bond of sadness at the tragedy we now watch unfolding before our eyes 

I urge you to read again @wildman1959 's last few posts and comments. I am with you, always and forever, no matter what. *NEVER FORGET* ....So, this Memorial Day. let us give special honor and remembrance to our fallen hero sister, U.S. military veteran, Ms. Ashli Babbitt: First Patriot Blood drawn in combat -- January 6th, 2021 May our generation live up to her courage, finish the job and fulfill their responsibilities. To avenge her blood, freely shed, that you and I may be free :purple_heart:

_I would just prefer us to be discussing a more proactive strategy, _  @windy 

We're on a slow burn right now, windy.

But when this shit can opens up, things will move very fast. IMHO.

If protesting is your thing, go for it, make your voice heard. If peaceful disobedience is your thing, awesome, I support you. If calling your congress man or woman and marching in peaceful protest is your thing, great.

For me, the line was crossed, Nov. 3rd. If I have to leave my home and risk everything I know and have and love, it won't be to carry an angry sign to a protest rally.  *When things go kinetic, it's weapons free. Do or die. 100% all in.  *
My motto: Flammus Vincimus! Flames Arise
Best wishes with your move to FL. I think you'll feel more at home there.
Thanks KAZ! I better :slight_smile:
I would call my self a Christian and once was told by a friend who was Mormon that Jesus was an alien, and that no human could perform the things he did. As far as the bible, it was made up of letters people wrote, and there was forbidden scripture that was not put in the bible because it was about bad things. All in all, I am always open minded and if your word for god is alien then so be it. Whether you believe in god or not, the bible is happening, whether it is God making it happen or Man reading it, and making it happen., its happening  I believe in a higher power that I call God, for all I know Adam and Eave could have been cave men?...LOL

Yes it is a cool song!
Good morning sir
Good morning all OKers!
And a good morning to you as well 
Good morning my compadres.
Get all of your yard work done?
My family history on my fathers side dates back to before the republic in this country. My aunt, his sister, was able to figure out we have had a relative fight in every war for the republic since the Revolution. All the way through to myself in Desert Storm and Iraq and supporting sorties into Afghanistan. I have the blood of the original 3%ers in my veins. We are doing what we can given the current circumstances but that is not nothing. Be prepared sister for when that day comes, they will rue the day they crossed all good Americans with their moronic bull shit. I will not take this lying down but patience of the hunter is required now‚Ä¶.
Yes remember SSgt Ashli Babbitt, USAF Security Forces veteran, Patriot and sister in arms. Never Forget‚Ä¶
No fixing the rearrangement of the pavers from moving a year old tree has turned into me finding that the shitbums I had install them had them skewed pretty badly. What are you having worked on today at your house? 
Yes they will. When you keep pissing into the wind you are bound to get wet‚Ä¶.they underestimate our resolve and depth of support we have 
So down here in the south we have these damn vines that grow over everything. Well they grew up the side of the house all the way to the top into the siding and into the attic. It caused a leak in the ceiling right over where we are going to put a powered table to help change my stepsons diapers cause he is too heavy to change on the floor anymore and it hurts my knees to do it. So they guy will pull out the vines from the house and fix the leak damage and patch up the siding. If he can beat the rain today lol
Yes vines can be invasive. I like the look of a vine covered wall but the damage they inflict isn't worth it. 
Once he does that I am going out with my hedge trimmer and cut down the bushes causing the issue. They protect the windows right there so I don‚Äôt want to take them out. They have vine killer at HD so I may spray that on them too afterwards to knock them down from invading the house again
That's a tough one when they are mixed in with something you want to keep.
Yeah and it‚Äôs getting warmer now so they grow faster. I will trim it all down it‚Äôs time anyway and see what‚Äôs left. 
Sounds like a plan
What do you make of that BL Ranch clip that windy posted last night @ 7:38pm?
Morning, Pilgrims!
I have not watched it yet. Figured I would watch/listen while driving later 
Good morning Redfox!
I won't say anything then. I look forward to your feedback

Thanks, windy! And thank Gov. DeSantis for us when you get there. Our governor in AZ is a putz.

Get the Signal app for texting. I joined Signal last week. Collecting OKer contacts ahead of the next deplat.

I expect the second half of this year will be one for the history books. There are a staggering number of developments culminating soon, from economic to geopoltical.  The Left is losing ground with the American people; their COVID campaign is losing steam.  The Left knows it and are in a panic. They need to try something new, create a new crisis, to solidify their grab for permanent power. 

For now, the Left is losing ground with the American people, albeit painfully slow. 

I know what you mean about changing gears from defense to offense. The leadership of OKers may miss the mark WHEN to switch gears. If so, I'm prepared to set aside my OKer patches, assemble a team of like-minded patriots, and go operational. 

For now, it's hurry up and wait. I'm also waiting to get vetted by OKer state and national. I think my request has been prioritized.  I want to work with leadership to get patriots OUT of their bunkers and start organizing in-person, teams, comms, command structure, logistics, and money.
Good morning !
Well that is interesting that BL ranch segment. Since I am not an infantry guy my guess would be to observe and report on the enemy position and if the opportunity presents itself take them out. Maybe get reinforcements going since they are an hour away
I expect the second half of this year will be one for the history books. There are a staggering number of developments culminating soon, from economic to geopoltical. Additionally, the Left is losing ground with the American people; their COVID campaign is losing steam. The Left knows it and are in a panic. They need to try something new, create a new crisis to solidify their grab for permanent power.

What will it be? What crisis does the Left have in mind? Likely economic. One of the traditional tactics of the Left is to impoverish the people. An impoverished people are not only dependent on govt, but an impoverished people have little time, inclination, and resources to organize and mount an opposition. 

For now, the Left is losing ground with the American people, albeit painfully slow.
Right, so it's like a practice scenario for possible coming events? I didn't know anyone did that. And I'm surprised that the libterds at YouTube permit it.
I don't mean that anyone practices prep, I meant simulated drills on the tube
Yeah I get what you mean and yes surprised they allowed that as well
:confounded: The Commies are destroying small businesses (72% of all jobs) utilizing the Scamdemic for two reasons:  1) Eliminate all the mom/pop businesses 2) Eliminate all the potential employees by providing more money to stay at home 3) Replace employees with robotics at the larger companies.

When the businesses are destroyed, and there are virtually no more of the 72% jobs, they will eliminate the payments to stay at home.  Big companies win.

Then what, USSA?

Well, thank God for sending Real President Trump who will be returning and taking charge to continue Making America Great Again.

At first I was like am I missing something hear? Has shit started that I don't know about. Kind of like the earth invasion skit from Orson Welles 
Lol yes me too
Dude presented that well
So guess what caused the leak in the ceiling?
I'd be, hey chief slow down and go over that part again! 
Lol yes
Squirrels or raccoons 
The sat dish 
Aha. So it's coming down? 
Been slow leaking for a while
Is it a larger old style or more modern 
Sheet rock is in good shape so he will just paint the stain on the ceiling 
Smaller more moden
Got the vines out no problem
Those installers I don't know. Use to do roofing with my dad and brothers. Anything mounted on a roof is sketchy. Secured to a chimney or vent pipe maybe, but through the shingles, nope!
Or off of a outside wall 
Yes there is actually a small mount still on the garage roof. Every house I see in the neighborhood has it on the roof
From another dish 
As an AF guy who used support Recon aircraft that belongs to the NSA or CIA I believe. 
So another accomplished day. 
Speaking of that. Got to get my sore ass back to it. Pavers, ya! About 2 1/2" thick and the biggest ones are 22 1/2" by 12". I guess it's one way to get back in shape.
Lol yes it is. On my way to my job now
Good morning NC

_Pope Benedict is the one and only living Pope (which he is), that means that Jorge Bergoglio is NOT the Pope, and never has been.

Nailed it Rev! Plus, where do we go to, to communicate? Smoke signals? Carrier pigeons? Telephathy lessons from one of those UFO aliens we've been talking about here? We just to find a broadly respected military leader willing to go rogue, and put a plan together fast to fight back. Time is of the essence. How about we start with a nice patriot cyber-attack on MSM!
THEY NEED TO BE THE ONES WHO ARE SCARED. NOT US! For as St. Paul tells us very clearly in Romans 8:31, "Nothing can separate us from the love God." Faith people!
It is obvious by their constant projecting that they are scared :poop: less of Patriots. Look at Rolling Thunder for an example.  They really do not want 1,000,000 Veteran Bikers descending on WaShitOn, even with 32-years of non-violent and peaceful gathering.  This is the first Rolling Thunder since Sniffy stole the election.  So, after 32-years, what do they think has changed that could affect the attitudes of 1,000,000 Veterans?

Hi, Sean, I got mine at 2ndamendmentpatches.com
Rest assured they already know who we are. They haven‚Äôt acted because we haven‚Äôt done anything.
Yes it is. Sorry I haven't checked on here in a few days. I agree with you that fanning the fire is probably counter productive. I really believe that Stewart should be an emissary of all the the members nation wide. But to accomplish that he needs to get constructive feedback from us. I guess maybe we need a delegate system of some kind for each state.
Windy, thank you for your kind words of confidence.  Florida patriots will be lucky to have you among their numbers. 

I'm not optimistic for the near future. Regarding the "Left is losing ground with the American people" I mean to say temporarily.  I am thrilled the Biden administration has given many thousands of Americans reason to join the fight for liberty.  More for us!  We need all we can get before the SHTF.  By and large, most Americans---many GOOD Americans---are in denial about the election coup.  Psychologically, I don't think they're ready to see the truth.  The truth is too painful for most people, including people I know personally. The truth is unthinkable. Unconscionable such a thing could happen in America. If true, each of us are compelled to ask ourselves, what am I going to do about it.

The best we can hope from the AZ audit is that a few more thousand patriots will join our cause. The Left will NEVER peacefully let go what they've seized. Furthermore, the Left will never let Trump run for president again, let alone allow a free and fair election. The Left will have Trump in jail before his 2024 campaign bus hits the road.  The Left is working on Guilliani and others right now. The Left will squeeze Guilliani for info leading to Trump's arrest.  The Left will also come after Trump's family.

Anyway. Not much more I say on this unsecured platform. I want to be ready to rock and roll when the SHTF.

There are so many factors to consider aside from simply grabbing a musket and pushing back the Red Coats. Factors such as staving off war and meddling by foreign powers while we we're busy pushing American Marxist into to the sea.  Central bankers and money reform.   New elections and reforms. Abolishing and reforming the FBI, CIA, and NSA. Maintaining a steady hand on our nuclear arsenal. Allowing the flow of fuel, energy, clean water, and goods to the market.  There are a LOT of balls to keep in the air. While we're busy destroying our enemy on the battlefield, we must be cognizant of what we want things to look like AFTER victory.

Even if we are not in here or if there where no organizations like OK, most of us would be targets because we are military or law enforcement or both vets. That alone is a threat! There are too many with combat experience around now after a 20 year campaign in Afghanistan to ignore. I would wager most are on our side. There are probably a lot of law enforcement who do not like what has been going on the last year and that‚Äôs putting it mildly. They are probably mostly in our side, so assessment would be we are threats no matter. Maybe this site and organization focuses us in one place but we are a threat to them no matter what we do
And it appears I have some stuff to watch/listen to on the way to Charleston today
Did you ever get your GMRS license from the FCC? Mine did not take more than a few days 
Hope all is well with ya
Morning sir
GMRS may come today? It was Saturday when I applied. 
Big brother has always been watching....
Behind the scenes..gathering 411
Waiting on patriots to slip up and run their mouth
I for one know what i am fully capable of....
And they know....
I dont have to snnounce it on media
Hell they built me this way
Death before dishonor!!!
Sad thing is she's right. The teachers union is a cancer in our society. 
Mine came quick within a week
Email notification 
  Did you realize that you have yourself marked as busy on the chat?
A red circle with a dash in it
Been like that for several days
Lol I set that when we went to TN OOPS
I applied on 18 March looks like and got my email link on the 19th
Oh I haven't checked my email. 
They are. When I was teaching JROTC I had to sit thru their stupid presentation during orientation. Waste of time
Check they send a link. I took a screen shot of it to have on my phone and you can always access it thru your FCC log in
It came in at 526 this morning 
Odd time for the fcc to be working 
I watched chapter 1 and 2.1 this morning
But is it?
Good deal. I'll have to try listening with the earbuds as I knock out the long list of projects to finish up. YouTube is funny though, shuts itself off easily while working with it in your pocket. 
I leave the video open on my phone and lay it on the seat even though I just listen 
Doesn‚Äôt shut off on me
I hear you. Part of the ears and eyes of big government 
I think his site might be better
Yes. The last aircraft I worked on where the reconnaissance version 135‚Äôs. Look them up and you will see what they are capable of. They stopped a few convoy attacks in Afghanistan when they got stupid and spoke over the radio about plans
RC-135, TC-135, WC-135
Good morning brother WKNC
Yes it is.....
I think we get so wrapped up in this shit..we forget just how good it is.
Everybody take a breath..sit back......exhale......
Android here. I can listen to pandora even as I scroll another website but the tube has to be up front so if my screen gets nudged in my pocket it stops. Driving in the car or planted on a table it doesn't stop.
Gotcha. Like I said maybe his site is better 
All is good hope you are as well
Food for thought, jpj recommended using a PO Box address on your HAM license so the antifa/ blm idiots can‚Äôt track you down 
Gonna do that and change my GMRS license address as well 
Good thought. 
Yeah agreed
I guess they hear a call sign and can look it up and see everything you give the FCC
Whose site were you referring to? I didn't get that.
The instructor on you tube, og
He actually recommended it in the first video I believe 
Oh he has a website not on YouTube. Now I get it
Late to the party

Yes it is

The RC-135S Rivet Ball
Rivet Joint
Cobra Ball is another version 
There are like 5-6

Constant Phoenix 
Open Skyes 
There are over 20 variations, Rivet Ball is the latest.
https://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/boeing-rc135/
Well it‚Äôs been 11+ years but yep that my old babies
Airforce guys, gotta teach you everything lol
They upgraded
My guess is they combined the RJ and CB
There was talk about that
They can listen across the entire radio spectrum 
I bet.
They fly around in training missions practicing getting signals and just testing their hardware and software capabilities 
They have 1 Achilles heal
Old airframes I wonder if the Rivet Ball are newer airframes 
I was the one that told you about the call sign look up. I meant to reach out to jpj to see if he thought we could get away with a PO box. The fcc regs require a good address so that they can inspect your station and antenna array. 
Did you on the comm thread?
That seems forever ago
No here on direct chat
Damn ok
There are provisions for clubs to use temporary call signs 
Age catching up
Hmmmm start a club?
That seems the best rout legally but I'll check with jpj. There still has to be a club and address logged with the fcc 
Guess I need to start playing brain games lol
Makes sense
Good morning, Brothers and Sisters!
Something I stumbled on when you and were talking about the info look up
I got 1 blm idiot down the street don‚Äôt want anymore
I'll find it again and send it to jpj and let him figure it out. He likes to come up with the solutions 
I hear that
Lol ok
He is a good source of HAM info

Yes he is
I'll  catch you back in later.

How‚Äôs to you sir and may the 4th be with you too
Having watched the Ashli Babbitt shooting at least a dozen times the shooter has a very distinctive shaped head and receding hairline from ear to ear. His forehead is sloped backwards from just above his eyebrows, neanderthal esk. This killer is identifiable beyond a doubt. My old tv box had fantastic frerze frame, the 4Kultra is terrible. Maybe one of us has the ability to lock a clear frame of this animal? Let's ID this POS and get it out there! Image below in my gab.
Ashli Babbitt SSgt USAF Security Forces, Never Forget
I agree they need to ID that guy or we must
Seriously his profile is unique to put mildly. 
It is should be fairly easy to ID him
Thank for this new information @ssgtgman @wildmand ...

Today and forever, I salute USAF veteran, Ms. Ashli Babbitt. I submit that (despite her heavily suppressed having been almost totally scrubbed bu thje traitorous MSM) was an true American war hero, the first patriot casualty of Civil War 2. And as such, she should be loudly honored by us this coming Memorial Day. 

When push-came-to-shove, Ms. Babbit, rose to the occasion when few others would, and came to the aid of our dying Republic. She full well knew the stakes (as did all of our fellow patriots who proudly attended the January 6th rally), the road it would potentially lead to,a and the price she may have to pay. 

Shot down for unarmed and in cold blood by a cowardly Marxist regime traitor and murderer. For no reason but her decision to exercise her God-given First Amendment rights to call attention to the communist coup she opposed.  

She was about the same age as my daughter. Indeed, she could have been any one of our children, any one of us here. Because of this traitor, Ashli will never have the chance to bear the brave patriot children who must ultimately be the one's to liberate us from the tyranny and proclaim American liberty once more. 

But you and I can all come together now, to take *physical action* to make certain her sacrifice (and all our war dead before her) will not have been in vain. As we say where I come from, "This just ain't right." America should not be under communist control. 

We must bold action now, or there will be many more Ashlis Babbit's and Kenny Harrelson's to come. Make no mistake, brothers and sisters, we are next on their hit list.

...My final wish is that I may be the one to take out her killer.

@wildman @madmarine4212  @Keeping.AZ #AZ #FL #TX #TN
@denbo Thanks Denbo! Will follow you back!
Anyone near Huntsville, ALabama on?
nineline91b  Those that reach the most people are public enemy number 1, the media, tv, internet. Senile Biden is trying to screw up as much as possible before the votes are found and shown he did not win.
Lol I we might have to take it to sudden death OT
Looks good! Looks like someone reposted it
Ahhhh both! No contest switch off daily 1A and 1B
The Ashli Babbitt murder clip!
https://www.bitchute.com/video/gaByvLTqf0md/
Yes I reposted it. Had to write the words in photoshop and post it as picture (words in the picture).
I also just tried to post the video of the shooting on gab. It wasn't permitted either. 
Fucking turd. No reason for it
I watched in the general thread. What a fucked up thing to do. If for nothing else there are other officers behind her. If he had missed you know they would have blamed all of us 
What a fucked up thing to do. If for nothing else there are other officers behind her. If he had missed you know they would have blamed all of us 
We have to out this fucker!
Those other officers know who it was
Hope the family gets justice
Not one reason to fire
I think it was part of the conspiracy to try and make it as ugly as possible. 
gab is pretty cool... been there since Jan21 after being urged to open a 'social media' acct...... somewhere!:laughing:  ...torba wanted me to validate who i was by using another social media acct... this was after he reached into my bank acct for pro status & a t-shirt purchase, sent to my home - i lit em up with that & they must have waived' the requirement because i got my darn blue checkmark!!!
FYI, The video of Ashli's murder is listed as being from JAYDEN X. Just incase my brothers and sisters here didn't know, he is a member of antifa and most likely blm as well. His name is John Sullivan aka "Activist John" & "Jaden X". I will attach the 00:26:23 minute video of him and a member of the MSM that traipsed along with him, recording his preplanned involvement in the Jan 6th incident.

Surprise, surprise. Just more reason to take them down. Like yesterday!
More betrayal! Its getting to be a daily fare of Republicans adding their names to the list of traitors. I don't think this one comes as any surprise to anyone here. The only two parties that exist now are Freedom and Tyranny--PERIOD. I certainly no longer call myself a Republican. A once-great party (just like a once-great nation) that has been disgraced by these globalist freaks who have sold We the People out to the oligarchs who now control our fate. That is, unless we choose to rise up against them. I am an independent Constitutional conservative--loyal to Christ and liberty alone and a movement that will do just that...and fight for our future.

THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT! All we have now are just individual patriots. like you and I, to speak out, rally the troops, and hold the line against pure evil. Jesus is King.
Good more the better
I‚Äôm no longer surprised. Self-interest drives most of the political class, not conviction or fealty to the Constitution. It‚Äôs human nature at its worse. I believe in the individuals w honor and commitment who can‚Äôt be bought‚Äî- their passion goes much deeper that the material.
The effort to brand patriots as enemies of the state will only intensify. We all have dark days ahead of us.

Oh I stayed up a bit later than I planned. 
But hitting my second mug of coffee now. I was responding to a reach out from windy. It takes me a while to get the words right sometimes. Unlike windy who it seems comes very easy.
Lol yes it flows like water for her. I was catching up on videos posted yesterday and also just watched OG to chap 3.3
Good stuff. 
Need my books to come to catch up 
A lot of the material so far I remember from college
That's good. What did you major in
Industrial Technology 
Which is actually Engineering 
That's awesome, this will be a breeze for you. I better get on the ball!
Lol I don‚Äôt know about a breeze
I think I have learned more doing this job 
That's just how it goes. I think the transition from control electronics to radio frequency and transceivers theory is going to be far from my past practice 
YIKES! Could they be any more transparent about their motives? We;re in for dark times ahead.
Looks like pretty much the same crap the Globalist, leftist, libterds are pulling around the "free" world!
I can't get over the media acting like for one second that Trump gives two shits about being alowed on Facebook. I for one would be disappointed if he ever used that platform again permitted or not. The day he was cut off from the big tech services was the day I vowed to never use them again. 
Good afternoon my fellow Patriots, 
So my usually cranky wife called me an asshole for leaving hand prints on the bathroom mirror while trimming my mustache and beard because I'm going blind ish. Not really just can't see for shit. And that name she called me reminded me of one of my favorite songs. So I thought I would share it with all of you. Hope you enjoy ;^)

Oh...the joys of marriage, they never end, they? Awesome song, though. Is this how guys really think? Never again marriage for me...lol
Still I think you will get it no problem
Yep and of all Armies, the French, THE FRENCH, are pushing back‚Ä¶.
Lol love Dennis Leary
I appreciate it. Really time to get focused. I allow myself, no I create distractions for myself. Knuckling down. 
Walking into the VA. Dental cleaning. 

Right go figure.
Oh joy got the VA tomorrow eyes 
And we all do that so does everything around us 
I have eyes on Friday. 
I hate eye appointments. They cancelled on me last year. Need my prescription updated
What happened this morning you got called asshole by the wife? For shaving?
They must have run out of white cloth to surrender 
This isn't a game anymore! This is an outrage and an insult to our great American war heroes--including my dad and both my grandfathers--as well as our current and already-abandoned POW's (including our own FL/OK brother, Kenny Harrelson, currently being held as a political prisoner in a Federal detention camp in Alexandria, Virginia on bogus charges, and being denied needed medical care). Any of us who have ever worn the uniform must vow with their every breath to ensure this POS dictator is stopped asap. If any further harm comes to Kenny while he is imprisoned, I'll personally take his (regardless of their gender status). Again, we must unite the tribes now, or face them coming for us and our families next. Even our beloved Trump warned of us of this very clearly, before he was forced out of office in an illegal coup. We should take him at his word and act accordingly! 

Remember folks...THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT to overthrow anymore. It was overthrown decades ago by globalist traitors we trusted, and who sold us down the river to the international banksters and the ChiComms, and covered up with the smoke and mirrors of their Big Tech/Big Media friends. Time for us to understand that we are already at war, and face the fact that we have only evil to conquer. From this point onward, we can't afford to keep pretending its otherwise. In doing so, we continue to serve a totally demonic Rokerfeller-led private bank system called the Federal Reserve, in bed with all our enemies, and most especially the CCP. We turn our backs on this challenge to our own demise. @wildman1959  @ssgtgman @Redfox @DaveyE7   #FL #MI #TX #TN

Good morning sir 
:thinking: *A Possible What If 2022 Scenario* :thinking: 

Been thinking...

What if Trump is focused on the 2022 elections, and does nothing...

What if it is a Republican massacre and they virtually own the House/Senate?

What if the House elects Trump as The Speaker? (The Constitution does not require that The Speaker be an elected member of Congress)

What if Speaker Trump aggressively moves to Impeach/Remove Biden and Harris? (Lots of crimes easily proven)

What if Speaker Trump then becomes President until 2024 when he is officially elected for a legal second term?

Speaker Trump would be more powerful than President Sniffer.

The Speaker being 3rd in line for the presidency could be accomplished in a matter of months.

All Constitutional and no need for military nor civil war.

Any thoughts?

Hog :cowboy:
There's no doubt they need to be rained in. Countries like Belarus, Tanzania & Uganda are and have shut down these big tech giants prior to and during their elections because it's so obvious that they are a corruptive force in elections. The US has become so corrupted that getting this done here is going to take We The People raising hell about it at the bare minimum. 
Hog, I love that what if! 
It would be nice to know, but Trump holds his cards close to the vest. One of his many attributes. 
And how great was it to see Mitt Romney getting booed on stage this week! We must get rid of the RINO cancers in the party!
Good morning big Davey
How's the weather there today. We are finally catching a two day break in the rain.
The GOP is looking to replace RINO Cheney with Elise Stefanik.  If the What If comes to pass with a Republican Senate, she would be a powerhouse once Impeachment was given to the Senate for trial.
Stefanik is a super hero! 
The current RINO list;
Sen. Burr (R-N.C.) -Sen. Collins (R-Maine) -Sen. Cassidy (R-La.) -Sen. Murkowski (R-Alaska) -Sen. Sasse (R-Neb.) -Sen. Romney (R-Utah) -Sen. Toomey (R-Pa.)
During the last fake impeachment Stefanik stood out strong and so well spoken. She has a bright future.
There is a story going round that there are 25 RINOs who are claiming Trump lost the election and biden won fair & square. No proof of this yet. Could be "fake news"?
But if it's proven true then we must work to evict these sons-a-bitches!
The Marxist State Media (MSM) is always looking for RINOs who will tout its propaganda.  They grab RINOS from all areas, local, state, federal, and even POS like Rove with his whiteboard. It is not too difficult to find RINOs when needed.
Been nice and continues to be, 70‚Äôs low humidity sunny
Got some rain the other day we needed it
Excellent idea!!!! 
Utah will not vote him back in I don‚Äôt think unless the Morman church messes with stuff. They control all of Utah
She is awesome! Future of our country as long as she can avoid getting corrupted
Burr is retiring there is talk of Lara Trump running down here! She would have my vote 
I'm thinking about putting together a list of *DX OKers and patriots to build a nationwide comms network*. For news and information. If you are interested, send me a DM. (Do not include your call sign when you DM me; we'll exchange all that info on a secure system.)

Hog, True indeed. But has been RINOs aren't worth our time. We need to focus on the active in office lists as we do with the no buy lists of the companies, sports leagues, MSM, SM etc. etc. who promote this marxist bull shit. 
That's great 
I'm thinking about putting together a *group of VHF/UHF hams, called "Repeaters," a list of OKers and patriots to build a nationwide comms network. *For news and information. If you are interested, send me a DM. (Do not include your call sign when you DM me; we'll exchange all that info on a secure system.)  

I will also put together a separate group for HF hams, DXers.  And share all info between the two groups. 

I want to do this before we get deplatted again. So let me know ASAP.

NOTE: I have not been vetted yet by our national leadership, but I hope that process will be completed soon. I'll let you know when I'm officially vetted, if you want to wait until then.  I understand. I've been an OKer since 2010. 

@stewart-rhodes  @FN9   @madmarine4212  @jpj
Many of the RINOs used by the MSM are present office holders at the local, state, and federal level.
@lonestarhog   I didn't know we had someone organizing OKer hams. Rocky?  That's awesome!  My intention is not to displace anyone is an official OKer capacity. Please send me some contact info for Rocky. Thanks!
KAZ, I don't know if Rocky is still around/active.  I have a copy of the last Comms Plan in my book.  I will see if it is on my computer/backup in .pdf
@lonestarhog   Fantastic!  Hold onto that list until I get vetted.  Afterwards, let's get that list updated and active.
Rocky does not appear in the Member List for this new Chat.  He might be here under a different handle.
In the HF chat, @lonestarhog  says we have someone in charge of a ham/comms list.  Below is my reply to Lone...

_I didn't know we had someone organizing OKer hams. Rocky? That's awesome! My intention is not to displace anyone is an official OKer capacity. Please send me some contact info for Rocky. Thanks!_
KAZ, Rocky's real name is Charlie Huffman per the last Comms Plan that I have dated July 19 2016.  I have his email and will attempt to contact him. In it he is requesting information from all HAMs.  Hopefully, I can find a .pdf or I will scan and create one for your use. I also have his Call Sign and will forward to you. You might be able to contact him by radio.
I‚Äôve found that the most genuine Republicans are at the local county level. They are my neighbors, and they reflect our values. The higher up the party food chain, tougher to trust.
Terrific. DM me and I'll give you my info so we can exchange info via Signal.
I am leaving for several hours and will return this PM.
Charlie is still listed at ARRL.  Gotta go...later
That‚Äôs because the higher they go they rise with the pile of corruption that gathers underneath them. That said I would still support them over others but am always aware they can turn on a dime
Anyone else see this?? What's going on?

:confounded: It was my post and was deleted several hours after posting.

There were numerous posts/discussions about identifying the perp, and .....

I got a couple of my team and we spent a little over an hour researching and analyzing.  We concluded that I should post what I did since we were all in agreement that the team who did that research had credibly identified the individual.  So I posted it.

No one responded, and, instead, continued with the posts about having to identify and locate.

So, I said the hell with it and deleted the work.

Hog :cowboy:
REDFOX  As far as the election there has always been crooked people, dumb people and a lot of cowards who go along cause they are scared of being unlike or being focused on. They are insecure and to weak to stand up for what they know is right. This leaves us and many others to have the courage to see the USA constitution remains intake cause it is our country and it's our rights as citizens. Anyone who try's to alter or remove the constitution is guilty of Treason and trying to overthrow a government. The constitution is the USA. S those most loyal are usually more the ones needing the country ran the way they and the president Trump see it.

And even if he feels he has to distance himself from us in the public eye. He is a strategist, and let's be honest, some of our people put undo heat on us when they got sucked up into that fiasco on the 6th.

@TaylerUSA on gab
Hey brother,
So check this out.
I just popped on a short while ago and saw a post from andyjack at 12:28.
"What happened to the posts naming Ashli Babbits alleged killer? Was the name not correct?"
I guess lonestarhog had posted something about it. But then deleted it because him and his "team" put in the work to ID the guy but no one responded!?üôÑ
So I went on and said Hog, from time to time to time we do get busy! 
Then I read on and the name was there.
So I plugged it into the web and I found that this journalist had posted it on April 13th. So I went back and deleted my comment to Hog. And pinned the journalists gab page on our site thanking him for his work! lol

Then I was thinking of the old phrase from that movie "lighten up Francis" and was going to go back and plug Hog with that. But low and behold I found a band under that phrase. It's called "Puscifer". Some great head banging tunes and their YouTube vids are very cool. Thought you might enjoy.

I'll leave Hog be. I just thought wow, the ego of some people to post something so important but to pull it a short time later because no one was showering him with praise for it. Then come to find that someone had already put it out there but it was pushed to the back burner by the MSM. What are we taking after plagiarizer Joe, posting shit that others worked on without giving them the credit due?
Fuck that my friend! 
Their needs to be a grand jury for this.
Hey I realized I'm being petty, sorry for that. Older brother with a ridiculously huge ego. I guess it still gets to me.
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=cN2Ny2FSjBrjw528E) @wethepeople2310   Thank you for posting this article. I read the article several times. The author of this _Newsweek _article, Jenni Fink, chose her words very carefully. She obscured who said what. In effect, Ms. Fink manipulates the magnificent subtly of the English language to reassign the accused. Very clever wordsmithing indeed!

Ms. Fink's article is literary subterfuge. We're at war, after all. Notice the conspicuous lack of sources. No one is clearly identified. What was said is not clear. The WHOLE article is fraught with omission and redirection. 

To what end? *Ms. Fink, her editor, and the publication are hoping to drive a wedge of division between Trump and Trump supporters among OKers. *

Thanks, Hog! How do we do that? When? 

Keep in mind I'm new to ham. Tech license only. Been studying to take the General in next couple weeks. Still setting up the shack.  I'm looking to collect and network with ham OKers and patriots before we're deplatted again.
How about tomorrow morning at 10:00 CDT?  You come into the Direct Message, like now, and click on the Three Dots in the upper right corner.  Then just click on OTR and everything is Off The Record.  I can give and send you the information you want for the Emergency Communications Plan, at least what I have.  I don't know if it is outdated, but a place for you to start.
I'll be working at that time tomorrow. But I'm free Saturday after 10am. 

Huh. I had no idea about the OTR feature. Cool.
Okay, Saturday at 10:00 CDT

Forgot you are on CDT.  10am AZ time, 12pm CDT. Good? Not good?
Well said, @denbo .  Upholding and defending the US Constitution will not win a president every popularity contest.  As for the Left, upholding the Constitution will NEVER be popular.  

Trump's dereliction of duty in failing to invoke the Insurrection Act, in perhaps a magnificent stroke of divine irony reminded all patriots this was always our fight to win, our responsibility, not Trump's.

Hey good morning sir, started reading this last night and then got busy with putting little boys to bed and such. I saw that too from lonestarhog and was wondering because I never saw it. He must have posted it then immediately took it down I never saw it or heard anymore on the topic after you posted about IDing the guy. People on here gotta remember we are on the same side and to put aside the egos or whatever it is. Brothers and sister fight so long as at the end of the day we make up and press on.
Lol no worries about thinking you are being petty, I am still bothered by the overbearing Italian mother thing growing up!
And in good news my ARRL books shipped should have them Monday the 10th
So I went back and watched og‚Äôs intro video again. I got his website that he posts all the different classes of HAM licenses videos. Here is the link: https://dcasler.com/ham-radio/
Look at the upper right and you will see the 3 classes and videos associated with them
And I will check out the band too!
I agree she is trying to drive a wedge amongst all Patriots and divide us. The media has been doing that and will continue too. 
Good morning NC!
Good morning to all SC OKers!
Good morning. Over the last several weeks, doesn't seem to be many getting on here.
Good to see I am not the only one up this early!
No not many at all. Still trying to find the time to hook up face to face with kt2806
Hey brother reaching out to you. You where going to send your number after our discussion last weekend. Hope all is well!
Did you watch FOX last night and Pete Hedgpath.... can't remember how to spell his last name.... well, his report on that guy that's going to remove everyone in the military that is associated with "radical Patriot" views?
No I did not because I stopped watching the news a long time ago. Was it good?
Send me a link and I will listen to it while driving up to Durham today
Pretty chilling when you think of the long term consequences of what will come from that. Its a step that's needed to transform the US into a Socialist/Communist country. They had videos of 2 Generals stating that it was their view that they had ZERO percentage of enlisted with radical views. They have to know that if this purge is accomplished, that this will result in completing the coup.
Ill see if I can find it
coming from which way?
From Charlotte 
Thanks for the link 
Well that link just gives you a one minute video. I think you have to be a subscriber to FOX to get the whole thing
Well that sucks. I will try and find it elsewhere. I do remember reading an article about the 2 Generals testifying about not having extremists in their commands
Good.  Saturday at 10am Arizona time

Good morning brother Davey
What‚Äôs up today?
How'd your eye appointment go?
I have mine at 10. Have to get my ass in gear!
Good morning Oath Keepers.
Thanks for posting that Hog. Jonrob was telling me about and after reading about this oath breaking SOB I am glad someone said something. Whether anything happens‚Ä¶..
That Fort Jackson incident is wacked ha! That young troop looks like a section 8 for sure.
Good got a new prescription 2 new glasses for free. 1 with my everyday progressive lenses and 1 for work strictly to help me see up close. No dilated eyes so that was good 
The DI incident?
Terrific. I'll jump into our DM at 10am AZ time Saturday, and click the OTR option. :punch:
That is good. I'm going to the  ophthalmologist, followup from my lazer retina repair. Dialation is a certainty! And lots of bright invasive light!
They took pictures so there was still plenty of bright light. Hope all turns out well
He is a very dangerous MFer
:pensive: I have always held my fellow Veterans in the highest regard and close to my :heart: ...all Veterans.  Sadly, to say, I now strip the title of Veteran from anyone who breaks his/her Oath, and too many are now titled Traitor :poop: .  When the time comes, there will be no Veterans on the other end of my sights, and my conscience shall be clean.

Sometimes the best offense is a good defense.  (180-degree flip).  So, I have to wonder why Arizona Patriots and volunteers from around the Nation have not secured the Audit, or is there a stealth operation?

Hog :cowboy:
Well if there is a plan I hope it's a damnd  good one and heavily backed by 2A.
Amen to all
IF the DOJ/FBI raid, the military (i.e. Chris Miller) had damn well better finally get involved.  If the military should take no action(s), then that will be the final answer to the question:  Is The Republic Destroyed?

I say, "Chris Miller" since this Austin :clown: is NOT the SecDef.  Chris consolidated all of SpecOps under his direct control, and it should have been for exactly this type scenario.

If SpecOps has to takeout the FBI, then do it!

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=DQArJiRx5iKBt9aDh) @lonestarhog  This is a very good question.  Two weeks ago, I raised the matter of AZ's audit and our role as OKer's to "upper management." I haven't heard back yet.  *The US DOJ has effectively bogged down OKer leadership to a standstill; we're stuck slogging through a gauntlet of legal landmines, barbed wire, and hedgehogs. *

Thanks my brother. Checked out as expected after the lazer. Now Monday checked for new glasses. 
Flashpoints. Likely Portland. Possibly Phoenix,  depending how audit proceeds.
This is so old that it was recorded in 240.  However, even at terrible resolution it is amazing how STUPID really comes through.  Also, I have always wondered about that girl.  Can't help wonder if she is rushing to clean the blood from floor and walls before the kids are no longer distracted by the DUH Agent...err...I mean DEA Agent.

If he had removed one or more of his balls, could/would he have been charged with exposing himself to minors?  Nahhhhh...who would charge him, DOJ?  Yeah! Sure!

Hog :cowboy: - I can also watch this repeatedly over the years. :grin:
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=CK84moPAMBXqLaXTh) KAZ, do you have a recognized Arizona Chapter, and do you have a State President and officers?  If yes, what is his/their position?  National shows a website for Arizona, but the link is bad.  

I remember the 60-Minutes coverage of (supposedly) Arizona OK Officers making comments.  I don't know if they really are OKers and/or officers.

Hog :cowboy:
Hog, AZ leadership is in transition. Helluva time for THAT sort of thing.

Yes just yelled at a guy who drove by to take off your mask YOU ARE ALL ALONE IDIOT! He looked around like who said that???!!!! Lol
:laughing: yeah i'm getting frustrated too,... calling out these idiots is unavoidable brother!!
for those trying to get OK patches - you might try calling WMTTC to see if they have any in stock - '2nd amendment patches' takes a bit of time as i believe they don't keep the OK minuteman/state patches in stock - i ordered a couple TX state patches several weeks ago with an anticipated ship date of next week sometime
Yes I would say good to go.

While Oath Keepers continue waiting "for the right time", or for Trump, the courts, the 2020 election, or the military to "step up and step in" and "make his move",  or continue sitting on their combat experience laurels because the enemy is "just a bunch of gender-confused, participation-trophy, cry-babies who'll wet themselves at the first sign of armed conflict" -
The enemy is honing insurrectionist battle tactics and sorting their numbers based on willingness to get their missions accomplished.

"Black Tip is legal in Texas."
I think you missed my point, Hog.  How does "Constitutional Carry" prevent you from having to pay your federal tax on a SBR, an automatic, or a suppressor?  That was the basis of your OP, that taxing a Right is infringing a Right.

How does it keep you off of a federal gun confiscation registry when you buy an serialized firearm?  That too is an infringement.

Good morning, All.
Good morning Redfox, davidswanick & my fellow Oath Keepers.
Good morning Sir
I got the ones I ordered about 2 wks later‚Äîgreat quality, btw.
You are convoluting a couple of disparate topics.  

My first post was in response to another individual and I was making a general legal argument that would apply to all Rights.

Then the conversation went off on a tangent and I was responding about Open Carry and Constitutional Carry.

Then the conversation went on another tangent that addressed Black Tip to which I responded.  I had already posited the legal argument for the rest of the post.

Simply, I was originally addressing the post of taxing guns and ammo out of existence for most people.  I have posted many times about the NFA, ATF, etc.  Especially about ATF "Rules" where I stated that I obey "laws".  What the hell is this "Rules" :poop: Are we supposed to be back in school with "Rules"?

Hog :cowboy:
I'm shocked none of the students rushed to the instructor's aid. Second, I'm shocked not one student walked out of the classroom. A firearms instructor who is that careless is a danger to himself and others. Get the HELL OUT of that classroom.
The poster boy for Gun Free Zones. :zany_face:
_"IF the DOJ follows through with threats against the Maricopa County Audit by sending in FBI SWAT to seize all assets...."_

Hog, I assume you were drawing a hypothetical.  But if you hear or know of the feds organizing an armed seizure of AZ election assets, please let me know.
Kaz, I only know what is reported, and then look at history to posit assumptions.  I put nothing past the totally criminal DOJ and its group of lawless thugs called the FBI.  Remember Ruby Ridge, Waco, Bundy Ranch, LaVoy Finicum, for just a few lawless examples.  The Commies are totally desperate and will do anything, the people and opinions be damned.
Yes, I followed the Bundy Ranch, Oregon Wildlife Refuge standoff, and death of LaVoy closely as they unfolded, under Obama.

DOJ and FBI have transformed into Gestapo. Gives new meaning to "G-men."  The Elliot Ness days of FBI are long gone.
Oh, sure! I'll be there!
Even better!
Should I bring something to shoot?
I've been told my request to get vetted by OKer at the highest level has been prioritized. I hope so. But I know they're swamped handling new membership, recovering from the deplat, and bogged down in legal matters.
I'll pay for your range fees
Out for now. Talk to you at noon your time, 10am my time.
I am preparing an email for you that will have several attachments for assisting in your endeavor to organize the HAMs.  Going OTR will encrypt and remove our conversation when exiting OTR.
Good morning Patriots!

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Back from an off grid road trip. Standing by (as always).
"Especially about ATF "Rules" where I stated that I obey "laws". What the hell is this "Rules""

And that is exactly my point.  You can't even buy a new firearm without following "the rules" created by "the laws" in the 1934 National Firearms Act, the Gun Control Act, the Firearms Owners "Protection" Act, The Brady Act, etc...
And yet, all of those "laws" are unConstitutional infringements on your Inalienable Rights of Life, Liberty, and Property which merge into the 2nd Amendment Right (the Liberty) to keep and bear arms (the Property) you choose to defend your (Life) against all aggressors.
Look, I get it - you gotta start somewhere and it takes years or decades of baby steps to get where The Uber-Left has gotten as far as encumbering an individual's Right to bear arms.  I guess I'm just trying to make the point that crowing about one little baby-step victory in the current climate of freefall towards Orwellian collectivism is kinda pointless.
Do a search here on Chat using the simple word MOOT.  You will see my writings and a video that subsequently supported them.  I am sure you know her as a top-notch Constitutional Attorney.

Hog :cowboy:
Until the turning point...
That piece where the DEA idiot shoots himself, he had a Glock. You must be aware of the safety issue with the Glock trigger "safety"!? Where the trigger is getting hung up on objects, loops, straps, etc. on the way into the holster, circumventing that safety.
You know I have essentially been stripped of my 2A rights due to an old DUI. But that doesn't remove what I consider to be gun logic from my mind. You stated "Empty the damn chamber!". Are you saying you carry chamber empty? Really! 
Sounds good. I probably wont shoot.  See you at one. Grey cadillac cts, Black carharhdt tee and jeans.
No I don‚Äôt at all, always chambered. When he cleared it he took out the mag  after he ran the slide forward. He was too busy showing off. No Israeli carry for this guy!
Good morning sir
Good morning all Oath Keepers!
Plus no ammo in a class period
I never gave any lessons to pilots on the Beretta with any ammo, maybe dummy rounds but otherwise nothing.
We are having my sons birthday party today, family not little kids thank God!
Oh, on my end the video was so grainy I couldn't make out any details. 
I didn't know the Israelis carry that way. I thought they were bad ass, Mossad and all. And where they are straight forward with things like outwardly using "profiling" in their security. I wouldn't have expected empty chamber BS.
I agree there. Classrooms with live weapons is for the range!
Yes they carry on an empty chamber and are taught drawn, rack fire
I handle every hand gun I have the same each and every time. 
Carrying my 1911 now locked and cocked chambered 
Sucks if they get in a confrontation and their non dominant arm is disabled. 
The 1911 is a beuty. And fail proof safeties. 
That Glock trigger safety is proving to be inadequate 
I have a Springfield XD sub compact that uses it but it also has a grip safety like. 1911
And my daily carry for work in my Beretta. 2 reasons, familiarity and round capacity. It‚Äôs my SHTF gun to fight my way home
If I am home I usually carry the XD
Love my 1911
Two fantastic choices. 
Lol I have a few choices
Morning Davey
I'm sure you do, lol
Good morning andyjack
I think my total is 13 firearms at this point 
Plus air rifles 
So 15
Some pretty hot air rifles out there
I have a .177 and a .22 air rifle. The .22 went thru a box, styrofoam and baseboard and dry wall when I tried it lol
It says is 1500fps
That's what I'm talking about. Put a can on it!
It‚Äôs quiet and I have some old tablets that don‚Äôt work anymore I am going to test it on
Cool. I have to get back at it here. Talk later.
Me too later on brother
This makes two people I know monitoring Antifa...
Thanks for this article David. Its inevitable that they are growing leaders and tactics with all the experience under their belts at this point. SR is under fire and cant be as involved. Who is going to step up and lead us?
What if it wasnt one person but a group with different expertise but coordinated
10am my time. Gonna grab a short smoke. Be right back.
Let me know when you return and we can go to OTR.  We both have to have an active session in DM first.
Okay, let's hit OTR
BTW, KAZ mentioned in a thread that he's been a member since 2010 and he's still not vetted at the senior level.
It had something to do with him and Hog talking about KAZ wanting to amass a list of HAM call signs. At which point he mentioned his lack of high level vetting. I know I've stuck my two cents worth in a time or two about how we should take a Q from the PBs. Their initial application requires a high degree of personal information be offered up. But things seem to move extremely slowly here. 
I just recalled that you and I spoke about the need for more organization here. You said we lost a good leader over a lack of humanitarian efforts being carried out. 
Who knows, maybe being loosely organized is part of the strategy at the top? That might be just what saves SRs ass from the frying pan regarding Jan6th. At least from what I've read anyway. 

mine might taking longer as i ordered a variety of things, i know custom patches  take longer - patience is a 'tool' i try to keep honed

lonestarhog, denbo, davidswanick & my fellow Oath Keepers. 
Bear with me as I try to make my point? I am fairly new to this "organization" but I've never been one to hold my thoughts when the subject warranted input. 
1. DaveyE7 mentioned that back when he joined, NC had a great local commander who was in touch with that group every day. But that they lost that organizational asset due to his desire that more community service missions be carried out weren't being met, so he jumped to Team Rubicon. Void ever since.
2. Just a couple of days ago Hog was talking with KAZ about his desire to amass a list of OK HAM call signs in case our chat goes down again. In his comments KAZ mentioned that even though he had joined in 2010 he had still not been vetted by national leadership. ?
3. This brings me to a point I mentioned recently about vetting and how we seem to be behind the eight ball on this matter. My point was that we could use to take a Q from the Proud Boys on this. Their initial application requires a deep level of personal information be entered for vetting purposes and background checks. Why not us?
4. The BS on 60 Minutes and the disgruntled AZ OKs. Lack of communication from the top?
- My rambling points are just a few examples of the things I've noticed that to me point to organizational shortcomings. 
5. Or maybe that's the plan, "keep it loose and sloppy" so nothing can stick to anyone (I should have said no accountability) (reading too many articles) at the top as our Country crumbles around us?
- Just saying! 
:rage: The Patriot Echo Chamber :rage: 

WARNING:  A Hog Rant Follows.  Secure the women, children, and Snowflakes.

Ranting/On

I have had enough with what I have labeled The Patriot Echo Chamber.  What is it?  Simply, it comprises the owners of so-called Patriot websites, video channels, and authors of missives that are regularly published.

These are a group of individuals who simply quote one another, interview one another, promote one another, privately converse with one another...a group who have their craniums so far inserted into the Land of Proctology of each other that no one from the "outside" is worthy enough to deserve a reply when contacting any of them.

Examples of this group:  X22 Dave, SGT Sean, AWK, G&G Jared, Scott McKay, Dan Bongino, and about a dozen others.

Why have they been contacted?  Because since The Patriot Echo Chamber produces idiocy like:  Take Away Your Second Amendment Right...Destroy the Constitution and you lose all your Rights...Liberals are this and that, rather than the correct term Progressives.  The old world Liberals are not the Progressives.  Are you listening, Dan Bongino?

All of them have been sent comments with supporting documentation.  All of them continue to spout the same misinformation that is echoed in the Chamber. No "outsider" may enter the Chamber.

Awhile back I informed that SGT Report (Sean) character about the truth that had been uncovered about John McCain.  It piqued his interest and he wanted to know if I would appear on his show.  I told him that SR was the man to have, since John McCain has always been a focus of his, for which he had taken much abuse.  Sean said that he did not know how to contact SR.  I told him that I would contact SR and with his permission give his cell number to Sean.  SR was excited about the interview that would be focused on John McCain.  The result?  That SOB never once discussed John McCain with SR.  The interview was about everything but.  Subsequently he has never responded to my contacts, as the Chamber has strengthened.> https://oathkeepers.org/2016/08/breaking-news-john-mccains-1969-tokyo-rose-propaganda-recording-released/ <Read the comments.

Okay, I could go on-and-on with example after example from the last several years.  Gonna go check my blood pressure.

Just an FYI:  The Patriot Echo Chamber exists, and I can produce empirical evidence that it does disseminate flat-out incorrect and misleading information.

Kaz is working on securing information about the Emergency Communications Plan.  He and I had a OTR today and he was supplied with information that I archived, but all other was lost with the deplat. 

Since I had direct involvement with virtually all of the OK tops in 2010 and beyond, I guess it was my vetting.  There was lots of involvement that laid bare who and what I am.  I mean, I don't hide the fact that I am a :pig:

Hey brother sorry had family over so been busy all day. Here is my information: DaveyE7@protonmail.com. Dave Emrick cell 801-920-0791. Yes it‚Äôs a Utah number living in NC because I have had it since 2002 when I was stationed out there. 
As far as vetting I do not know how much I have been vetted since I have been a member since 2013, I just renewed and sent my DD214, Retiree ID and DL with the check so if they want to they can vet me. And yes things move slow it seems and maybe that is by design. I still don‚Äôt see what they would have on SR for anything because as long as I have been around OK he has walked the walk and talked the talk always. Yes we lost our NC leader here and when I met up with WKNC he told me some things about NC OKers. JonRob and I were talking in the NC thread about the small amount of activity in there. I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs good for me to just talk with like minded folks and get info and bounce ideas. Hopefully National is more organized than we think‚Ä¶
Been some hell raisin goin on! Check out the red ? mark at 2:01pm ;^)
Will do
At the end he asks for his M4 and a dad grabs his kid and runs out 
You already read up on that. I hadn't noticed your response above.
The one with Hog and the AZ audit. Yes read up in that. Good conversation that‚Äôs for sure and good points. I read all of these things and we all have good points and pieces to make a complete puzzle just not sure we know how to get it all together‚Ä¶.
Wow! Excellent technique! Very simple! Where the hell was this when I was practicing close in techniques in which I found myself a lot at the hospital???!!! Thanks for sharing ssgtgman!
Kind of the point being made by denbo, davidswanick and I. Leadership? 
Yeah I know and I wish SR would get on here more. Maybe we don‚Äôt know the big picture of legal issues they are having and how much time that is eating up. Maybe that‚Äôs their purpose, they the idiots on the left
But local organizing is important and I have been trying guess I need to get back at it
Oh and my books just showed up today 2 days early! Gotta get studying!
definitely adding to library! TY! SSgt! :thumbsup:
Good deal on the books. 
I hear you on the local organizing. And I certainly understand the twisted left and their relentless efforts to undermine anything and everything pro America or Constitutional in nature, like us Oath Keepers. 
I do appreciate your supporting SR, that's a good trait. I'm also sure that you can see how in this time of upheaval in our Republic that we need more leadership not less. There may be little time left, there may be a peaceful resolution, but I doubt it. I can see how some are frustrated with the slow pace and I let that pull me into the fray of that conversation. 
You have a good night sir. 
You too and I am always hoping this can be resolved peacefully, but prepared to fight alongside any brother and sister here. I agree and wish for more leadership here, I have been for 8 years of membership. Guess that‚Äôs why I let it lapse a year or two. Anyway have a good night sir!
I'm always glad to share and once in a while actually contribute something worthwhile. 
You all have a good night. Signing off.
You certainly nailed how worthless and cowardly this group is.  A lot of tough talk, but it's always followed up with wanting someone else to do the heavy lifting.
Gotcha, well good to have you around!
6239103999, look for me on signal
I wish I had a good answer for those questions, @andyjack
Yes - they will be told that you are a "threat" to yourself or others.
Yes - they will follow their orders.
Yes - your neighbors will thank them for their service.

Good morning, good people!
Good morning all Oath Keepers!
8019200791 is mine. On Signal as well 
Good morning sir. I am set up on signal also now in case we get shut down again 
It was posted to the general thread jonrob2012
Good morning NC!
Good morning,  
I also use signal. I think many of us have learned of these new methods of communicating that have become more popular since the big tech giants shutdown our President. 
Good morning brethren! 
I remember we used to use wickr at one point also
I set it up this morning after madmarine sent me his phone number
My fianc√©es stepbrother was over here yesterday and he was talking about everything going on with the vaccine and stuff in very biblical terms. Revelations stuff

Hog :cowboy:
I woke up thinking on how I jumped head first into the discussion about organization here yesterday. 
Then looking at my back patch on my vest "In Memory Of Our Troops Defenders Of Freedom" written on the inner perimeter surrounding all of the US Military branch insignia. 
That made me think of our motto; 
"Not On Our Watch". Really! 
Look at what's going on 
"As We Watch"!?

Oh boy. That must have been fun!
If wasn‚Äôt bad and he is better than I originally thought. He is VERY opinionated. I listen a lot as I have always done and comment when needed. Keep my thoughts close to the vest in those settings. He is very similar to all of us except maybe some anti police elements in there. Not 100% certain what to make of him but I think if the SHTF I would want his help
He has had some bad run ins with police and the first time I heard him going off a few years ago about cops I developed a bad opinion of him 
Good approach, always good to have another on the team if SHTF.
Some cops are bullies, but that only gets worse if the individual is not respectful. 
I forgot to take several of my meds last night and around 11:30 my mind started racing. Couldn't sleep till after 1:30. 
I have a couple of friends in mind that I am contemplating sending a letter to via mail for some security with directions to our or should I say in my mind, evac site. That way we would have some able bodied folks around. They are not 100% involved as most of us but I think would be in a hurry if SHTF
Meds for sleeping?
And yes they are for sure. Those are the overzealous idiots every job in the world has
I am prejudiced against one group, idiots. That‚Äôs it and they are everywhere, otherwise I will give anyone a fair shake 
I've been diagnosed with severe PTSD. 
I know, but that shit is real. 
There was an article out a few days ago about the USPS going through our mail, spying on us for the Feds
No totally know that it is real. I was too when I came back from Iraq and had issues the rest of my career. When people start firing off fireworks around here I still jump. I cannot go see 4th of July fireworks
Probably still have some issues but I am not going to go to the VA for it. I have enough targets on my back
I feel your pain
Yes I heard that about postal so that‚Äôs why I have been thinking how to get the info to them securely. I may just have to drive it there and put it in the mailbox 
Have you heard the song Indestructible by Disturbed?
I would try some type of encryption method. There are some good apps.
I had not listened to it in a while and I was driving a while ago somewhere and it came on randomly on Spotify. The opening is the alarm we both know from Iraq when mortars and rockets have hit or are about to followed by small arms fire, explosions etc. Well I am not kidding while driving I all of a sudden took a deep breath in and smelled cordite and Iraq and the burn pits and all of it came flooding back until the intro was over. Man that got my attention 
I bet it did. I'll check it out when the wife isn't around. 
Or pop in the earbuds. But I prefer the speakers. 
In my mind I went back to Iraq and an incident where we had mortars landing pretty close to our building. The Merc chat was having trouble figuring out where they were landing so I went to our front door to see if I could spot and one landed about 100 yards away. Saw it impact‚Ä¶ 
Went back and told our desk folks and they put it out so the Army could counter fire back
That's close enough thank you very much, right!
Earbuds are good I actually prefer them now
Yes that was 1 of 3 damn incidents I had. So yes PTSD is real. But I would never make it all out to more than it was. I never went outside the wire that wasn‚Äôt my job but there where days you wanted to go shoot back at those idiots
I couldn't stop thinking about how I jumped into the heat of the discussion yesterday. Then this morning when I look at the back patch on my vest I had to pipe in on that thread again. Check it out when you get a chance. 
I read it and I agree totally. I wish I knew the right answer or solution. I also wonder how long we watch. My thought is going to the 10 rules and I was going to review them and make an honest assessment if they have stepped in any of those. Like guns, they are trying to regulate them to death but so far have they really tried to disarm us? Certain bs legal instances like your situation yes, but not en masse. I have said to that‚Äôs my line personally. Do not leave me defenseless then no one is safe
I have been waiting 8 years for some action. The security details and after disaster stuff has been great but I feel we need to do more before or if it goes kinetic
I still say no matter what SR does need to speak out more and with us. And he may have to bite the bullet and go to the Lame stream guys
I hear you. Not sure what the answer is.
I have been more active now than before on the old platform. So I have been trying to reach out to other OKers here in NC/SC to no avail
I just sampled that "Indestructible", I see how that would grab your attention. Especially if you weren't prepared for it coming on.
I mean I did meet up with WKNC as well and he is very involved with the NC state militia and asked me to join. 
Yes exactly because now when I hear it it‚Äôs not nearly as strong but comes to mind because of the first incident 
Again I am a newbie but it seems as if many have gone silent after the Jan6th incident 
True and I think they are scared of the feds. I have decided in my own mind no matter if we are on OK or not as combat vets we are targets or actually just vets period
For me it was Jan6th and the BS aftermath that drew me here
Agreed. And all the more reason to have alternate means of contact. 
I look at my son and wonder if I am doing the right thing. I get very conflicted. Should I continue the fight for the long term or give in and be around for him. Either way him and the rest of the family may be unprotected without me around. 
But I stay at it
I keep the OK patch as my wallpaper I have except for the Boston Marathon bombing year
And do not hide that I am an OK
That is true indeed. But I think that vets, members and civilians who have multiple firearms should set up stash sights or auxiliary locations. Don't keep all of the eggs in one basket. If ten feds came at your door to confiscate. I think it would be an effort in futility to attempt to fight them off. 20, 30 more behind them. That to me is where protecting your family comes down to common sense. You would certainly be putting them in harm's way if you chose to fight. 
I penned a letter to the Texas branch in that regard a while back and heard nothing 
Yes I agree and I have been thinking about stash sites and what to stash. Can‚Äôt be totally defenseless in the mean time. Seems like we have shootings everywhere day in Charlotte now
I call it "GLARR" Give, Live, Alert, Regroup & Response.
I guess survive to fight another day has to be the montra
Good one 
I like that 
I think we should be adopting these types of plans in advance of attempted confiscation. Before we loose numerous members to suicide by cop
Yes or even other Patriots. I think no matter what we will. 
I wrote that down I like it so much
And part of that letter included the need for alternative Alert methods of comms. So that this plan can be successful 
I'd maybe change response to respond
Yes that‚Äôs my concern too. I even think about comma if I am caught away somewhere with home and the family. 
Yes either word works
In my letter I mentioned that if carried out correctly we could actually increase our arms. Because what is taken can be taken back with interest. If planned. 
I should post that letter to general 
Email me a copy I would like to read it 
It goes to the frustration one feels when no response is had from leadership on communication like this
I'll run it by you first. Your cool head is appreciated. 
I feel that as well. I used to tell my guys no communication the cancer that will kill us
Cool head??? Wow don‚Äôt think my fianc√©e would see it that way lol 
Nor my wife. I'm angry!
Same here!!
I'll pull it up and shoot it to you.
Oh and when my books came yesterday the stepbrother asked me what they were and I told him. He said from what it sounds like HAM radio might get outlawed soon‚Ä¶.
We started talking radios and I showed him what I had recently purchased 
Just read the letter. I do like it and it is laid out in a very good structure. It is a plan I can get onboard with. Instead of the general chat, why not try sending a dm to say SR, jpj, lonestarhog, KAZ and see what they think. I like the idea and it keeps to the cooler heads prevailing mentality. 
I sent that on March 29th titled Emergency Aler Response! 
I'll do that. 
Though KAZ was the one who got me on that thought process with his comments on how there is no way he will allow anyone to take his weapons! 
I believe windy was also part of that heated back and forth with me trying to make the point that committing suicide by cop would not help our cause.
I can't find SRs DM. Do you have a user name for him?
His is just stewartrhodes
I remember that and I agree. We have to live on to fight especially with families. Unless we get early wind of it happening there would be little to no chance to evacuate the family and firearms to safety
Part of my point exactly. With this plan in place many of our members would be alerted to the started confiscations
SR just recently joined the comm thread so check in there for his name to be sure
As it stands we are like sitting ducks
And there is a - between his first and last name
I plugged it in that way first. Nothing came up
Go to the comm thread and touch his name, his profile will come up and there is a message button to send him a message
And it may be _
Looked like that when I did the above
To the Oath Keepers leadership; 

It has become more and more likely that this administration and the feds are going to push gun confiscations upon us.
We who have been active on the chat since it's been back up have had numerous discussions about this. A common ideology is to get into a gun fight with any attempt from LEOs or feds that come seeking our guns! I have and am suggesting a different approach.
I call it "GLARR" Give, Live, Alert, Regroup & Respond.
1. & 2. We are worth much more to the cause alive and out of jail. There will never be enough of them to hit any large number of us at any given time. So if we can stash some guns and ammo in a safe location great. If not, then roll with it. Give with lawful resistance but the key is "GIVE so as to LIVE" and fight another day. We will not survive a shootout from our homes against overwhelming numbers of LEOs & FEDs. Not to mention that Rambo mentality will get our loved ones killed along with us.
3. ALERT your OKr brethren to the onslaught so that they can gain the advantage and Regroup. We must adopt a Oath Keepers Emergency Alert System. We've seen how easily they can cut our chat. I for one would have no way of reaching out or alerting anyone and let's be honest, an emergency alert needs to be immediate and direct. Hoping that someone checks their chat as part of an emergency alert (if they've left it up) is not adequate.
For OPSEC it should be compartmentalized. Keep it local or regional with only select members having direct contact to neighboring regions.
4. Regroup. We must adopt pre-determined rally points with primary, secondary and last resort alternatives.
5. Response. This will continue to be a political battle but let's face reality, if it gets to this point political battles will have the effect of a fart in the wind.
This part is for full out SHTF so take it in perspective. Instead of us being caught at home in the middle of dinner or sound asleep, we can apply the upper hand. Anything that can be taken can be re-taken if not multiplied.
I believe that time is of the essence here.
This administration is writing EOs like they're going out of style. If we blink it may be too late.
Thank you kindly,
ssgtgman
SSG Gary Landers
It's sent! I included jpj, hog & kaz
And of course SR
Good see what they say but it makes sense to me. 
Well thought out so good job sir 
I just don't see standing your ground with your family in the background as a viable plan
And as far as I can tell there is no plan
Remember the 7 Ps
Agreed I have been thinking a lot about that lately and putting them in the line of fire defeats the purpose of protecting them
7 P‚Äôs?
Proper prior planning prevents piss poor performance 
Air Force guys!
Now I remember that
I have probably said that to my troops but a long time ago! 
Thought of the day. Let us not forsake the "Seven P's"!

Hog :cowboy:
That‚Äôs ok I am sure you will tell me 
Good morning Patriots!

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
I would not want them to think I think of myself as leadership. Informally maybe but not formally by any means
I hear you. I meant as a means of keeping you in the loop.
So far only one unrelated response from Hog boasting about his writing's!
I know you did I just don‚Äôt want them to have that impression of me 
Lol of course
I won't hold my breath expecting anything to come of it. But if SR doesn't even respond to me, I'll have to do some soul searching!
Exactly! Until the people start voting out asshats that go on to appoint other asshats it will continue kicking the van down the road. Protest just do it on the sidewalk and while you doing it get some FACTS! Then maybe you won‚Äôt have to protest 
I may have a couple of Oath Keeper patches to hand off to you.
Yeah I feel ya. I have thought about just dming him and imparting some SNCO words into him as I used to do all the time to my Commanders. Whether they wanted to hear it or not was irrelevant they got it. 
Hang on to those 
We have to stay together but I do understand the frustration 
Either way you stay in touch with me so if you hit the road finally and get out of MA you can come on down here
That's for certain
And right now in lew of no other comm plan I would email or signal you in case something goes down 
What a joke...
Rodger that Kemosabe!
I will be making another push down here to organize NC OKers. Kt2806 lives a county over but he works like 5 miles away from my house. So he is like the closest OK to me. 
Since I drive around a bunch I can hook up with SC OKers as well all the way to the coast, same for NC OKers
And I will be going out to Elizabeth City, NC soon sight of the latest cop shooting of an innocent man. Insert eye roll‚Ä¶
Sounds like a good reboot effort. Can't beat in person comms.
Have a happy mother's day you mother! lol
No it went really well with WKNC. Looking a man in the eye helps
We had a good talk
Morning, You are probably busy today but lets meet up at the coastal gun counter sometime this week.
:clown: The so-called "police" witnessed a FELONY - assault with a deadly weapon - when that BLM/ANTIFA character drew and pointed the weapon at the gentleman in blue.

If the gentleman in blue had drawn a weapon and pointed it at BLM/ANTIFA, he would have been shot, or at least arrested for Felony Assault.

Hog :cowboy:
Exactly. They are trying to scare people into not reacting. The comparison to Nazi Brown Shirts is spot on‚Ä¶.

"If the British march
By land or sea from the town to-night,
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch
Of the North Church tower as a signal light,‚Äî
One if by land, and two if by sea;
And I on the opposite shore will be,
Ready to ride and spread the alarm
Through every Middlesex village and farm,
*For the country folk to be up and to arm.*"

Hog :cowboy:
Yup, now that sounds like a "plan"!
Don't know why I even bothered? 
You bothered because your writing reflects not only the strategies/tactics of our History, but the same of knowledgeable and experienced Patriots like Paul Howe.

In my meetings and seminars, I have stressed that Patriots must start to identify all members of any local/state/federal agency who would ignore their Oath and conduct unconstitutional actions/operations.  All these :clown: are members of our communities and are well-known.  Identification of both the good (Patriots) and the bad (Traitors) should be known to the Patriot groups as part of strategic planning.  

I have always stressed, you do not conduct an assault on a high-value asset target without first identifying all defenses and the tactics to neutralize them.

I guess the first question is:  Who is an organizations strategic leadership?  It is tough to follow vapor, no matter how bad it might smell. :poop: 

Hog :cowboy:
:wave::slight_smile: Happy Sunday Oathkeeper Brethren! may all your BBQ pits be filled with dry mesquite & your beers nicely iced!!!

@ssgtgman  Thanks for opening this discussion. I agree, we can expect the feds to come down hard on firearm/ammo manufactures, retailers, new buyers, as well as current gun owners, including gun confiscation. The Left's tactics are as predictable as the sunrise. They ALWAYS come for the guns. 

@lonestarhog  Thanks for the article. Agreed, a terrific article. I saved a Word copy of it. 

Gary, to your point _"We must adopt a Oath Keepers Emergency Alert System. We've seen how easily they can cut our chat. I for one would have no way of reaching out or alerting anyone and let's be honest, an emergency alert needs to be immediate and direct. Hoping that someone checks their chat as part of an emergency alert (if they've left it up) is not adequate." _   I am in the process of contacting the OKer who used to be in charge of our Emergency Communication Plan. Am trying to gather contact info, including ham call signs and rallying point times/frequencies in advance of our chat forum going down again. 

In the meantime, Gary, collect as many contacts as you can. My name is Kenton Long, my phone 480-628-6186, email kentonlong@cox.net. If the chat suddenly goes down, call or email me. (Write down my contact info right now. Good ol' paper and pen.)

Grabbing lunch. HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY to all OKer moms!
OUT for now.
later bro!
Don't know if you read my previous note to you. I've since deleted it.
I got a little testy over Hog's smug remarks and then only gave a glance at his next one and blew a gasket without giving it a chance. KAZ thanked me for starting the conversation. 
I think missing a few happy pills yesterday along with my neighbor and the fence issue may have put me on edge.
Thanks for being a "sound" sounding board.
Was it after my last nite saying I was going to HD to fix a toilet? If so did not see it
So that was his answer after you sent your letter to all of them? I saw where you said Hog was boosting about his writings but nothing about it since. Not on here
And no sweat we all get irritated from time to time some of us more than others, namely me 
Yes a bit after that. It's better you didn't. I was pissed off. But I'm good now.
KAZ passed on his contact info. So we'll see. Maybe something will come of it?
Shit man pissed off is ok with me brother. It happens. I think we are all men and women of action by nature it seems and we want to do SOMETHING to stop this tide‚Ä¶
Well there ya go
I meant to ask how far away is Paine St from you in Winthrop?
And that‚Äôs good KAZ passed on his info, he has been around a while I remember him and Hog from the old chats
I'll check that st. Not sure off the top
Great my Aunt lives there 
Only 0.6 miles 
Cool. What does she do?
Unhappily married! 
Retired she‚Äôs over 90 lol. My uncle died back in 2005. She moved to Winthrop from East Boston a long time ago after my grandparents passed. She lived with them in an old three decker and she inherited the house. Sold it and made a hefty profit bought her dream home in Winthrop
My moms sister so all of my moms family pretty much still lives in the area
My uncle used to sell duty free stuff at Logan
Cool beans. Ya 90 is a bit much for me lol.
You are literally around the corner
Email is DaveyE7@protonmail.com
Yes. Plug it in the google map. 146 River Rd.
I see it‚Äôs like 5 minutes. Nice
Driving would be 1 minute at most. .6 miles
Small world
Pizza time. Later on my brother

Later I was Skyping with my mom so she can see her grandson. 
Well why am I not surprised? She is a NY Republican after all which means watered down Dem although seems like not so watered down‚Ä¶.
didn't trump endorse her too??
:unamused: WTH??
Damn RINO‚Äôs too to bottom scrub needed in DC!
:angry: GETTIN SICK OF THIS :poop:SHOW!!!
Yes denbo yes
Pizza? Papa Ginos? Or are they out of business???
Isn‚Äôt McCarthy from CA?
He is so that makes sense‚Ä¶..
No they're still in business as far as I know. My wife got a stack of small frozen pizzas from the local market. Made here in Winthrop at the Winthrop Arms Hotel.
Must be good
They're plain cheese but she adds fresh vegetables, mushrooms & olives to them. They hit the spot.
How's your mom doing?
My Mom is 88. Just lost my Dad this year at 94. Lived a good life. Was fine up until two days before he passed. No time to really suffer so I guess if you had to choose a way to go?
Yeah that would be the way no suffering
She‚Äôs good she‚Äôs the baby of her family so that makes me and my brother the youngest grandchildren on my moms side
She is 81 about to be 82 in June 
Dad is 85 to be 86 in Nov
Did you read that article about Elise Stefanik on the general thread? Another asshat shows it‚Äôs ugly face
No I'll go check it out. She's a super hero. Loved her during the fake impeachment BS.
Well she‚Äôs off the cool list let‚Äôs put it that way
Oh really! 
Be back in a few
Wow what a shocker! She totally had me fooled by her performance defending Trump during the fake impeachment. Good damnd thing we found out before she got to take over LC's leadership roll. Though we still must work on dumping these RINOs. Now we have another to add to that list!
Holly crap ha!
Wow she put on a good show during that fake impeachment. Totally had me fooled! 
Yes what a bunch of bs
We have to make sure this isn't fake news though!
I wouldn't put it past the libterds to fabricate this to kill her chances 
I think it‚Äôs legit. Did you see the tweets from Ann Coulture?
And her voting record is public record
I mean I hope it is cause like you said she was a rock star during the stupid ass impeachment
But I feel like it is
She is a NY Republican
Ok my queen is home so we have to celebrate Mother‚Äôs Day later brother
Yes if the Colter part is legit then it must be true. I won't go on the "Twit" to check shit. I'll leave that up to someone who hasn't pulled the plug on the big-tech like I have.
Good thing she was outed. 
Now we need to look more closely at Jim Jordan (seen to her left, our right) and Kevin McCarthy, reported here to have sold Trump on this RINO bitch!
Where ever the path leads us, we must shine the spotlight on RINOs and pull the flush cord on their time in public service. 
üí•THE TEXAS SENATE MUST FIX CONSTITUTIONAL CARRY BILL ERRORSüí•

Hello fellow Texans,

As you may have heard, the Texas Senate voted 18-13 last week on the Constitutional Carry bill, HB 1927.
Unfortunately, the Senate, led by Lt. Governor Dan Patrick, created some major problems.

Whenever the Senate adds any amendments to a bill already passed by the House, that bill has to go back to the House. The House can concur with the amendments and send the bill to the Governor's desk. Or it can call for a conference committee to work out the differences, then send the final version back to the House and Senate for another full vote.

However, the Senate created a worse problem.

Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick was told ahead of time that at least one of the Senate amendments, if adopted, would violate House rules. This would allow the anti-gunners to kill Constitutional Carry in the House on a technical violation-before the House could even decide to concur or go to a conference committee.

Despite knowing this, the Lt. Governor still pushed through his packet of amendments and refused to listen to multiple warnings.

The Senate can still fix this problem-but only if it acts quickly.
Take Action

Please call Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and your State Senator immediately. Tell them to work with the House to fix *HB1927* and send a strong Constitutional Carry bill to the Governor's desk.

Call Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick at *512-463-0001*

Or, use our handy email form to write an email that goes to both Lt. Gov. Patrick and your State Senator.
Contact them NOW!

The legislative clock is ticking. Please take action immediately so Constitutional Carry doesn't die on a procedural defect added by the Senate.

Then be sure to share this message with all of your friends and family who care about our rights. Be sure they call the Lt. Governor and their own State Senator too!
Good morning all Keepers of the Oath. 
Me neither never been on it and definite won‚Äôt get on now
Good morning to you sir
Good morning, DaveyE7, and good morning, All!
I did some work yesterday. Had not tried my plate carrier with my web belt with attached shoulder harness. Worked out some equipment issues and need to get a better magazine carrier for on front of the plate carrier as well as an IFAK. Otherwise I should be good to carry 200-300 rounds if need be. Went on AR500 where I bought the carrier and looked at some options. Bought 2 plate carriers in black and OD green for us last year. 
Good morning Kemosabe 
That's the ceramic plate?
Good morning all.
Yes Verona‚Äôs carriers with ceramic steel plates
When we got to Iraq we still had the old issue kevlar body armor. Then after about 6 months those were swapped out for the plate carrier type but they realized they didn't have the plates. They still kept our old gear. We were without plates for another 2 months.

The sleazy tactics of the libterds never wane!
We were issued Kevlar flak jackets at home station prior to departure. We got to Iraq and got the carriers and plates
You got our plates! lol
I believe that cv19 was definitely a planned bio attack. Not so sure about the vax? But then that's probably wishful thinking on my part!  üôÑ
Your lady had to work yesterday or was she just getting home from errands last night? Hope she had a great mother's day. Oh crap, I got so tide up with shit yesterday I forgot to call my mom! WaOhw!
She works every weekend at the hospital we both worked at. So yes she worked
Good morning Krissy,

Lets meet tomorrow around 11:00 at coastal. I will text you tomorrow morning to confirm.
Morning. Did you get my email?
I was trying fix a PT table that has multiple pads on it. One pad attaches to other with 3 1/2‚Äù long pins with c clamps on either end. Well 1 pin broke the other bent. So I removed a C clamp and tried to hammer it out. It‚Äôs so rusted it‚Äôs not moving. Applied 3 in 1 oil penetrate to break it free and nothing. After an hour of beating on it I called my folks and told them I was having no luck. So now they will have to buy a new table which doesn‚Äôt bother me, what does is not being able to get those pins out and fix it. I usually don‚Äôt fail
Always be mindful of what the quiet ones are doing. Totally agree Hog and love the Stooges reference and video!
I did... already responded.
Cool, my email is being blacklisted at times and Im trying to figure out why.
That sucks. This has a bit of a smell to it, but hands down the most fantastic penetrating lube period!

OK, sounds good.
The swing out tailgate on my old Jeep Wrangler was so frozen that it seemed the corner of the Jeep was going to bend as I forced it. I tried PB Blaster (which I had previously thought was all of that and a bag of potato chips), nothing, WD, you name it. Then I found an article on this and had to buy it online. Sprayed it and 2 hours later it was like a new hinge. I had already bought replacement hinges but never used them.
I may get some just to have on hand 
Also my neighbor had an air ratchet that was frozen solid. He kept it but never had Hope's of it working again. After my tailgate experience, we tried it on the air ratchet. Boom 1 minute. Like new. I'm not shitting. This is awesome stuff.
Sounds like it
I think their sales people should be shit canned! This stuff should be everywhere. 
Yes I agree
I know somethings I could use it on
Oh well I get credit for a sale since I know they will buy a new table
Gina walk my boy Reggie on the beach. Good luck with that.

I saw the initial attempt by the Calgary health department and local police to come in during a service. The pastor tore them all a new ass hole. It was great to see him stand his ground. 
Sorry to hear that they arrested him. Shameful!

As was stated here on our site before, LEO's are breaking their oath of office to protect their pensions! F-ing sad. But I love that pastor.
Yes I know 
We need a whole lot more like him in government! 
Damn dude you ok?
Former Army Medic I believe
Oath Keeper for sure 
I know, I think I'll be alright but I seem to be pressing my luck in a clumsy way.
Yeah stop doing that lol 
Just got done working out 
You've posted some great articles. That Alberta pastor is awesome but what the Leo's and local government are putting him through is awful! 
Yes absolutely. Did you see a PM from Ottawa is in his side too bad he can‚Äôt do anything about it
That pastor will know what tyranny looks like
All should listen not just us
Ok tune to eat dinner or at least start preps. Later brother and get on that ice

It is completely Unconstitutional.  The (worthless) Federal Reserve Note states:  *"This Note Is Legal Tender For All Debts Public And Private"*.  It is CURRENCY, which is established by the US Government; not to be confused with "money".  If you don't understand the difference, do some research. It states NOTE, and what is a NOTE, a DEBT instrument.  Debt cannot be MONEY.

I hear gas will go up to $4 plus on Tuesday
Last week, Pinellas County, FL Shell station went from $2.72 to $2.85, today dropped 2 cents ($2.83).  Still waiting for the gouge to start.
The pipeline mess is a false flag event I think. I think the commies of the dimwit party hacked in to drive prices up and make America see fossil fuels are bad. Just another way they eat away at our freedoms and reset America. Such bs
And good morning NC
Good morning sir
Gas shot up from $2.69 to $2.79 here in Charlotte. Gas station I went to yesterday had no mid grade or premium
May not be a bad idea at the local level‚Ä¶..
Yes he would know Nazis and Commies. Why do you need a SWAT team to arrest him? Seriously these LEO‚Äôs are idiots‚Ä¶.
Good morning to as well 
Did you ice up yesterday? Feeling ok after your fall??
Good morning all SC Oath Keepers!
Good morning all Oath Keepers nationwide! Keep the faith and stand strong all!
Law enforcement at times like this one is nothing but political libterd theater!
Agreed. That pastor will be back they won‚Äôt keep him down
He is a great example of the fight for freedom! 
No doubt. Some of the clergy and other jobs in the US need to take a lesson from him! Someone who knows tyranny! 
When UN troops start marching on our streets, we had better get out those big ass fans and start throwing some shit at them!...

So the fiancees ex husband the two older children‚Äôs dad wants the 13 year old daughter to get the shot
Literally "Amen" to that!
hey brother
As you can imagine I am not in favor of it. Especially after that video I posted of the those 4 Doctors and Nurse discussing it
hey brother
Hey brother good morning too ya
Oorah,Do or die, gung ho,gung ho
doing okay?
All good here, you?
listening to some stuff on gold and silver
apparently time to buy again
yeah all good
looks like leadership is gonna vette me
Good they should. Someone with your experience needs to be out front leading
thanks brother
I've lead men in battle overseas,  I guess it sticks to you like glue
Coffee done time to hit the grind. Yes I am sure it does brother. We will need that I am sure one day unfortunately 
I hear you. I personally don't see what the hurry is. They are just releasing it for the kids on emergency authorization. Tell your girl to tell her ex to wait for it to hit full approval. It has just received full approval for adults. So just be safe and at least give it some time on them and for the full approval. My opinion 
Yeah, sadly. But we didnt ask for it
Yeah I will try and talk with her. She‚Äôs at that difficult teenager stage
things are getting forced on us all
I'm sore this morning, but then I'm sore many a morning. I'll be back at it again today. Probably put my back brace on though.
we should plan some events
memorial day coming up
Does your 13 year old want it or the ex? Have your girlfriend talk with her ex as above. Unless the kid wants it, that's a different story? 
I would still try and persuade her to wait for full approval. It won't be long and just play it safe
Different subject; 
Are you familiar with arduino technology?  Is it like a PLC just more compact!
I found the answer online. Arduino & Rasberry Pi require writing software to do the job of a PLC. 
So do you write computer language?
Hey MM4212. 
how you doing?
I'm doing!
What's up?
yeah I hear that
wanted to talk to you and get to know you better
thats all
Sounds good
were both Vets, aren't many of us in here
I was chatting with DaveyE7, is why I didn't respond sooner 
all good
I think maybe more than you'd imagine 
nah, there are some
theres plenty that are, but they aren't online
I'm fairly new here but I can name maybe 10 off the top of my head
I think far too many took to radio silence after Jan6th, unfortunately! 
The ex is insisting on it saying we will all need it eventually to do anything. I tried to talk to my fianc√©e about that video but thanks to stepbrother she is almost completely against conspiracy talk
that was an issue here in AZ
Jan6th was what drove me here
No I don‚Äôt write computer code
So you know KAZ?
I am afraid I won‚Äôt have any input into her getting or not getting the shot 
I know many
Yes agreed
yeah, some what
I call him KAZ for short
just got approval to personally vette him
I'm not sure if you are familiar with the OTR (Off The Record) function here?
I may try with my fianc√©e again because like her Ranger dad I don‚Äôt give up
I talk to leadership on other channels
what is OTR?
I found it here last week. Not available when using the app version. It's in the pull down menu. Both parties have to be on simultaneously and except the OTR. All is encrypted but I still delete after conversations for OPSEC 
that is why I use signal brother
I use that to
wouldnt use anything online
where are you?
Behind enemy lines! Massachusetts 
call me on signal, lets talk
What did you have in mind mm4212?
I may send her that video and tell her to watch it before deciding
Been thinking to about firearm dispersal

She knew Gerry Rhodes, years ago. I met Gerry years ago at some EARLY OKer meetings. Back before we had state leadership organized.
you busy today?
Am getting ready to work this morning.
let me know if your free for dinner
Thanks for the invite. Will let you know a day I'm free.
Kait wants us to meet
I agree.
you and I are gonna be the instruments in the valley
you think so?
Hey apologies. I had madmarine4212 reach out and he wanted to talk on signal. So we spent some time on the phone.
Yut Yut
you should call me
Hah! Only 2 OKers in the Valley? I guess it's just me and you.
theres more
ive been contracted
I'm free for a call after 5pm today.  Yes, let's talk and meet asap. I'll look at some restaurants between Scottsdale and Surprise.
no worries, let know
I'm sorry that you're struggling with that vax issue and your 13 year old. But try and not let it consume you. In all likelihood the Pfizer vax will be gaining full approval for kids as it has for adults. And that video is just another opinion, they're like assholes, we all have them ;^)
IMHO these next three months we will see some major changes from the status quo. Hold the line, prepare for lost ground to be retaken and hold bad actors accountable.

:nerd: Time For Another Oath Keepers History Lesson From The Archives :books: 

Years ago (circa 2012/13) at just about the time that Obozo was supposedly reelected and inaugurated, and about a year prior to Bundy Ranch (April 2014), there appeared out of the mist an "Oath Keeper" posting on the old Forum.

Virtually daily this individual would challenge the integrity, resolve, courage, dedication, and fidelity to the Oath with rhetoric about The Quiet OK Patriots cowardly inaction(s). There was even a couple of others who responded with laughable replies such as:  "My bag is in the car and ready to roll".  The destination of the "roll"?  Shitcago!

Being the nosey Hog that I am, certain pertinent questions just had to be asked about the "roll", for example:  Is there a National Call To Action/Arms? What is the command structure and who is the Mission Commander and staff? What is the defined Mission and who wrote the Mission Statement?  Who is the in-city POC and where is the billeting and staging area?  Have or will teams be assigned based upon tactical requirements, and have those been defined, so that the necessary logistical support structure is in place prior to the "rolling" arrival?  What extraction and medical structure has been devised, or will local support of EMS and hospitals be expected/required? .....Etc.....Not a single question was answered.  

Eventually, SR entered the Forum and less than surgically expanded the geography of the person's Land of Proctology.

After SR left the Forum...:cricket: :cricket: :cricket: 

Beware of those publicly attempting to instigate kinetic actions/responses, and antithetical to The Quiet Patriot.

Words without actions mean nothing.  This group is more interested in interviews and words waiting for others to act out of bravery and actually do something.

I did it, I called 1984 the "T" word!
Troll ;^)
I don't know if there is a way to see who makes an expression, like a thumbs up etc. But someone put up a face with the finger on the lips like "shush"/ don't say that. So I deleted it, thinking it's probably not my place to pipe in!
Though 1984 is definitely a punk ass bitch!
Do you share the feeling that 1984isNow is Alphabet Soup?
I can't say that for sure but I do believe he is and has in the past week exhibited signs of being a troll.
I ran some of his lippy comments by DaveyE7 and he thought troll and suggested I report him. But I thought I would let it ride and see if he was just having a bad day. But hear he is back at the same shit talking BS again. "TROLL" at the very least!
I am in favor of just letting him rant, digging his hole deeper.  Then I look forward to SR showing up.  I remember what he did to the one I wrote about today.  Poetic justice will be so sweet.
I assumed that was you that posted the shush symbol so I deleted my comments realizing it was probably not my place to interfere
YES! It was me. NO! you should not have deleted them.  I was joking with the shush.  It was supposed to mean that we just remain quiet and let the cops do the work.  But there was no intent to have you delete the posts.
At the very least he is a real hot head. And can't think past his basic emotions 
I agree and would not want to be with him when/if the SHTF.
That's ok. I can take a hint. And at times need a nudge to restrain myself as well. But I'm a quick study compared to 1984
Does anyone know his background? Nothing but his name on his profile?
There have been many times I typed just to get the frustrations to a manageable level, then clear it without posting. I hear ya...
I would truly like to see a much higher degree of vetting. Background checks & the whole 9
Agree, and no idea about his genesis.
I keep mentioning how for the Proud Boys application you have to give up a hole lot of personal info. No reason we shouldn't be the same
Are you a history professor? 
I only ask because you are quick with the quotes and knowledge 
Moi'?  History?  Nope.  I was studying to be a physics/math teacher, then the Draft came along.  I have over 200 hours in various disciplines that I acquired during my time with IBM, from three different universities.  But none to do with History and none focused enough for a particular degree, unfortunately.
Well you retain well. Some days I'm lucky I can remember my own name
I am really quite ignorant.  People just seem to hit on the few things that I have knowledge.
If you're ignorant I am lobotomized

This wagon train has been on the road for a long time. Information and knowledge equals power. The mission of OK hasn‚Äôt changed, has it? Some things to consider. The Art of War. :eyeglasses:  How are things in your County? Is your Sheriff backing you up? Are you backing up your Sheriff? Do you know if your sheriff is a Constitutional Sheriff? Start at the bottom and work your way up. Example; look at the parents who recently ran out the school board and voted in new board members and put a stop to their absurd mask mandate at school! Yes! This is an example of how it works from the bottom up. Every one of us has unique skills and talents to exercise, flex and implement. How do you operate in your AO? You in a blue or red zone? Information and knowledge equals power, the mission of OK hasn‚Äôt changed. Have you, can you prepare your community for what soon comes? Are you dug in, prepared to stand with your local patriots? Until the call to action is loud and clear I will continue to ‚ÄúBe prepared, and prepare yourself, you and all your companies that are assembled about you, and be a guard for them.‚Äù. Yes this is good. Hold the line, it is time to put a stop to the advancement of the enemy who is attempting to take more ground. Those parents who took back their school may need protection just the same as the small business owners that OK protected from attacks by antifa Marxists. Our brothers and sisters suffering under the unlawful administration of Biden/China deserve our help. I hope all of us have contributed to their crowd funding to help them directly in that way. 

‚ÄúNow Here This‚Äù is where I except to see a CTA from OK. The Holy Spirit will speak to me directly and continue to set the pace and direction of my personal actions.

They blasted ‚Äúanarchy‚Äù in certain cities and called on Americans to support law enforcement personnel and insist that district attorneys, courts, and the Justice Department enforce the law equally, fairly, and consistently toward all.

They also argued that the mental and physical condition of the Commander-in-Chief ‚Äúcannot be ignored.‚Äù

Hog got back to me shortly after I deleted my comments in that thread.
He asked me if I thought 1984 is alphabet soup? I told him I wasn't sure of that but that at the very least he comes across as a troll and told him of the recent interaction between 1984 and myself and how I ran it by you and your thought then that he might be a troll.
We had a good discussion and I asked if it was he who added the shush symbol to my comments on that thread from 1984? He said it was him but that he didn't mean for me to delete my comment. But I told him it was alright, that I to sometimes need to be rained in and have my heels cooled.
I'm definitely feeling a lot more inclusion since sending out that DM.
Thanks for your guidance and friendship.

The NRA, probably the single largest organization standing for freedom and the American way, does not belong in New York and should not be contributing to the economy of one of the most anti-gun, corrupt, mismanaged, highly taxed libterd run states in these United States.

:fire: The Quiet Patriot Story Of Burnet County Texas :fire: 

My county was, like so many others, content with the status quo, and resistant to any proposal of change.  We had a good sheriff dedicated to serving the residents of his county.  The vast majority of residents participated in the political process every two years; otherwise, remained detached from anything that interfered with the perceived calm of everyday life.  The Marxist State Media (MSM) was the dominant source of information.  It was time to shake things up.

First on the agenda was to secure the involvement of a few of the more politically active and influential residents.  An email was composed and sent to the selected ten explaining the necessity of ensuring that we reside in a Constitutional county.  They were introduced to The Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA), of which I have been a long-time Major Life Member.  We solicited financial pledges to send our Sheriff and Chief Deputy to the next seminar that was being held at The Woodlands, just outside of Houston.  The strategy was to ensure that the Sheriff Department did not have to secure the necessary funds that were not in the approved annual budget.  Within a few days we had the money for registration/seminar, and $100 cash for each to cover incidental expenses.  This was to deliver a strong message that the residents of the county wanted their sheriff and deputy to attend.

We then contacted Sheriff Boyd and Chief Cummings and explained CSPOA, that all funds were pledged, and would they consider attending.  Upon reading the supplied information, we received a very positive response.  A week later, they were in training conducted by Sheriff Mack and a plethora of experts, especially versed in Constitutional Law.  They returned strong supporters of the Constitution and a whole new understanding of the duties and powers of the County Sheriff.

Next was to attend the meeting of the Burnet County Commissioners Court.  Sheriff Boyd attended and spoke highly of his recent CSPOA experience and was a strong advocate that a resolution must be passed declaring Burnet County Texas a Sanctuary Constitutional County.  It passed with 100% support.

Now the focus has turned to the residents with scheduled meetings and educating the county residents with truth and overcoming the ingrained propaganda.  Minds are becoming receptive and involvement growing.  

Our county will not only ensure strong resistance to any outside unconstitutional actions, but the knowledge and training will provide a force multiplier in support of our Sheriff and his department.

One OK Quiet Patriot starting at the county level and expanding throughout the neighborhoods and farms in a stealth fashion without raising the noise level by one decibel.

Thank you sir
So here we go again with the double standards when applying the law.
Dr. Fauci directly lied to Senator Rand Paul at a Senate hearing regarding the NIH's funding of gain of function research at the Wuhan lab.
But nothing to see hear!
When I see Fauci making the rounds on media outlets, flipping and flopping his COVID protocol advisories like a gaffed tuna, I see a small, frightened man. He's desperately nurturing his new born celebrity in hopes it will ease the blow when the truth of his involvement in developing COVID becomes known.
Amen to that KAZ
:dart:   Fauci and NIH circumvented US law in order to continue funding and developing this virus. COVID was not born by a bat in China. It was genetically engineered in the US and moved to Wuhan, for further development.  This, reported nearly a year ago.
The report on Congresswoman Elise Stefanik came too late.
As more and more "Republicans" speak favorably about Stefanik it looks like she will be taking LC's leadership roll!

Hog :cowboy:
Keeping.AZ, The documents spell that out indisputably! Then when it was determined to be too dangerous it was banned here and moved to Wuhan. Where the US and Canada continued to fund the research. Though it is possible that US funding via NIH grants may have gone under our government's radar ie. illegally! 
Or more likely the deep state commies where behind it the whole time
The arrests, abuses, and indefinite detention of patriots weigh heavy on my mind.
As Rahm Emanuel once stated, "Never Let a Crisis Go to Waste"!

Retired Army Colonel Announces Run Against Liz Cheney.
Colonel Denton Knapp, of Trabuco Canyon, California, (R) Wyoming Congressional Candidate.
Is a California Republican a viable option, military service or not?


It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood here today Kemosabe! 
How's it going in your neck of the woods? 
Not sure if I mentioned it already, but when madmarine4212 called me on signal (just to get to know me better he said) I think he was vetting me?
But to the point, after talking a while, he actually offered me a job on his gun range! I was truly flattered. I told him about my 2A situation. He said he has helped others in similar situations. He said judges in free states are a lot more apt to cut us slack.
But I don't see AZ on my list of desirable places that I'd care to relocate to.
:poop: <-----Describes almost all California Congressional Representatives

However, there is the likes of Devin Nunes and the Navy Veteran, Joe Collins, who was cheated out of the victory by Mad Maxine Waters.

Colonel Knapp graduated high school in Gillette, Wyoming in 1983, and appears to have been born in Wyoming.  He is returning to Gillette.

More vetting is definitely necessary.

Hog :cowboy:
My point exactly, Vetting we must do!
Ford Pinto.
Is he a brother OK? That would be the ticket!
Hey brother raining cats, dogs and everything else today! That‚Äôs cool he offered you a job. My mom, stepdad and brother relocated there years ago and went back to MA for a year and hated it. They love the weather and it is a good place to relocate to. I would have stayed in Utah if my ex hadn‚Äôt did what she did 
And sounds like he was vetting you
Him and I were talking one day in the general thread and he said knew all about me from National he was implying
May I suggest that you contact him or his campaign and make a formal inquiry.  I have done this with other candidates for all types of public offices.  My inquiries were for any of the Patriot groups to which I belong. For Example:  I first met our Sheriff when he was making his first run, I asked if he was a member of CSPOA.  He was not and was not familiar with the organization.  However, he did express support for the Constitution.  Now, in his second term, he recently attended a CSPOA seminar.

Hog :cowboy:
I would but he'll probably want to know if I'm in his district and I'm not even in his state!
Expect a spike in carbonizing.
You don't have to divulge your location.  You will be surprised how new candidates in primaries are so receptive to all inquiries.  No points lost in trying.

Hog :cowboy:
Ok now that was stupid! None of that matters in serving your country, not questioning that just the ridiculous pandering. 
True indeed. 
Back during the sham impeachment BS. I found the addresses for VA homeless shelters in Maine and Alaska and wrote to those two dirtbags Susan Collins & Lisa Murkowski using those addresses in my email. Not like talking to those RINOs was even worth the effort. But I felt better for venting on them.
That's a good thing I'm sure.
I'm not sure how high up the chain he is but either way it felt good to have someone take the time to reach out.
Maybe our message is getting through?
I understand the intent of the video was to highlight what he was talking about but one thing at the end makes another point in the overall fight to get out country back. He said reading the comments is uplifting when he feels down. We must never forget to do this for each other regardless of which organization we belong to. If we don‚Äôt stay in this mentally and United we will lose. And yes Shithead is an asshat clown period! Emailing my senator now
It has to eventually so we keep at it

Great effort must be taken to stop this, but with bozo biden and cumface harris in the driver's seat they are determined to tear down 2A. If we can hold them off long enough for the majority's to flip in the House & Senate we may be safe.
By the way. Do you know when the House & Senate will start adjusting seats per the latest census? Is that on hold till 2022?
I use paper bags

Good morning Moonshine
Good morning to you as well
Looks like a clear day here.  Finally.
How are you all in gas down there? 
Yes here too
Prob by today 60% of stations out of gas
I got mine  yesterday. I went during the rain hoping there would be less people.  at first yes but by the time i filled my tank and cans the lines were out the parking lot.
What state are you?
NC Charlotte area. Went day before yesterday into SC looking for gas and pretty much all out. Managed to fill up with non ethanol 87 octane at $3.69 a gallon 
Heading down to Columbia, SC for work today so hopefully they are ok
Reg. where i was at was 3.99 but it beat driving 20 mins than searching for an open station
People hoarding is not helping either. Pipeline is already pumping again I heard
Yes, it will take a few days to pump than distribute.
Miss Pres. Trump yet?
We do yes for sure. Stupid ass occupiers of the White House 
Well...he won by an overwhelming vote of the People and now has a mandate to make us Socialist.  All we can do is Obey.
Wait until 2022. His mandate will disappear 
If he can physically last that long 
And yes barfed up my breakfast
We can be sure 2022 will see the Dems and their violent groups in the streets burning again.  They "won" Georgia so we are expecting them to pour resources into our state
I hope the voting reforms down there will help that this next time around 
All Biden needs to do is warm a chair.  IMO he is just cover for those behind the scenes.
I hope but there is still issues.  Remember, our state turned down a request for an audit
We voted for Voter ID up here and we are still waiting for it to happen. They keep it tied up in the courts 
True but it can‚Äôt get worse
And yes Little joe is a puppet 
That much is obvious.  It amazes me how much the Dems are able to accomplish and have arrested yet when the GOP has control they do nothing, say nothing, see nothing, accomplish nothing.
Agreed. Not 100% sold on who they want to replace Cheney and the optics look like the GOP is in chaos which is what they want. They need to stand United and keep fights internally inside the party. But they never do
But our grassroots have really taken off.  Local elections here are if you are not pro Trump, if you are a RINO, if you talk a good game yet do nothing you are voted out
Good. I know in most of NC it‚Äôs that way but the big cities, Raleigh, Durham, Greensboro, Charlotte same old tired Democratic strongholds 
I am not a fan too.
I can feel the liberalism when I go to those places and around here
Me neither haven‚Äôt been since I was a kid during Carter
Cities belong to the Dems. GOP retreated from those areas decades ago. Trump expanded the base to include more minorities. Yet the Est GOP doesnt seem to want to grasp this
We must be the same age
Yes they have and I grew up in deep blue MA so I know it when I see it
Must be
i was inner city Cleveland until 84

I left in 85 went to the military never went back, 1967 here
I wound up in WV at an aunts.  Went into the Army and never went back lol.   thats how i found myself in the South
67? does that make you a Hippie baby? lol
I was a honeymoon baby lol
Parents where not hippies thank God! My dad is from OK my mom from MA
My dad has deep red roots
Mine too.  My old man moved from WV to Cleveland.  Thats where i was born.  My family is Conservative.  Really just farmers. Lumber. Cattle, tobacco.  Whatever could make money on a farm
My grandfather on my dads side hated FDR and was a business man all around OK. Whatever he had to do to make money he did
Died in the wool Republican 
Grandpa respected FDR for his leadership during the war and the CCC but as for fiscal policy not so much
Of course in Georgia FDR is a God.
Yeah I‚Äôll bet of course my moms side is all deep blue‚Ä¶argh!
Sometimes I wonder if that even matters anymore. Seems like no differences between the 2 anymore
No Dems as far as i know in our family or wifes.  Wifes family isnt far from Warm Springs where he went for treatment and had his Little White House
No there is no difference because they both are globalist.  Why focus on main street when you are focused on globalism. Same goes for wall street
Lucky you lol no awkward family discussions lol
So her family likes FDR, but says the rumor around those parts is that his wife was gay and everyone knew it
Soit wasnt arguments, it was dirty laundry.
Makes sense and I am sure that was an arranged marriage
Lol that‚Äôs better
Alright gotta go hit the road and hopefully make it home tonight. Good chatting stay safe down in GA
Drive safe, Br!
Will do
And good morning to you
That's good, a night out, quality family time and a break from this chat. 
It was for sure
I hope the rain past there. We have another sunny day üòé
It did it‚Äôs cold but nice. Just been trying to find gas to go to Columbia, SC and back today. Just found some thankfully

5. The mRNA jab delivers a synthetic, inorganic molecule (medical device) that programs your cells to synthesize pathogens in the form of the spike protein that your immune system will constantly have to fight off FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE! 

6. The CDC inflated the death rate for Covid19 by: 

A. By instructing medical practitioners in its March 24, 2020 directive to ascribe the cause of death as Covid19 for all deaths, 

B. By paying hospitals $13,000 for every COVID case and 

C. By paying hospitals $39,000 for every COVID patient put on a respirator. 

D. Also, the CDC lumped pneumonia, influenza, and Covid19 into a new epidemic it called PIC in order to inflate Covid19 deaths 

7. The CDC later admitted that 94% of deaths had underlying conditions. Of the 527,000 COVID deaths only 6% were actually caused directly by Covid19, or only 31,620. 

8. The survival rate for Covid19 is, therefore, roughly 99.9%. That's one person out of a thousand.
9. The PCR tests do not detect SARS-CoV-2 particles, but particles from any number of past virus infections. Law suits are pending. 

10. The high 37 to 40 cycle thresholds used for COVID PCR testing yielded 85-90% false positives. But, now with many getting the "vaccine" a lower threshold of 28 cycles for post-vaccine testing is being utilized. Trying to prove the "vaccine" works? 

11. Therapeutics and prophylactics for coronaviruses, like Hydroxychloroquine, previously approved, suddenly in 2020 were banned because, according to FDA rules only when there are no alternative therapeutics can untested vaccines be cleared for Emergency Use Authorization. Hmmm - ban something cheap and approved so you can push an experimental jab and make billions - nice! 

12. Front Line Doctors who try to explain the benefits of proven therapeutics are being silenced, and some have had their license suspended. 

13. Fauci and the CDC have flip-flopped on masks, contaminated surfaces, asymptomatic spread, testing, and social distancing. IMHO, either it works or it doesn't. 

14. Documents prove the media was the key player in creating the hype leading up to the promotion of vaccines and that lifting lockdowns is used as a carrot to get people to accept the jab. 

15. Politicians are caught on camera talking about the theater of wearing masks. 

16. The CDC owns the patent for the coronavirus that is transmitted to humans; also, a patent for a Covid19 test was filed in 2015, and Covid19 test kits were being shipped around the world in 2018 

17. Vaccine companies cannot be sued for injuries. 

18. Bill Gates is on record pushing for the right injections to lower the world population by 10% to 15%, and a call has been made for his arrest and trial at the International Criminal Court.
19. Covid variant injections are to be marketed without safety trials, Fauci confirmed it. 

20. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) buys and resells injections at a markup, about $4.6 Billion worth every year, and owns over 20 vaccine patents. 

21. It is against the Nuremberg code to force vaccinations on a person, and informed consent overrides public policy. 

22. Federal law prohibits employers and others from using vaccines under EUA as a condition of employment. 

23. In 2018, Bill Gates' INSTITUTE FOR DISEASE MODELING released a video modeling a pandemic starting at Wuhan, China. 

24. Lockdowns have had no effect on the death rate. 

Conclusion: After looking at this data, I conclude that this "pandemic" was planned. The vaccine response and banning known remedies was planned to provide Pfizer, Moderna, J&J, and all the stakeholders (Fauci, CDC, politicians) with a new revenue stream they will keep going for years. We have been scammed big time.
Hi, y'all. Not surprised that things have been quiet here. I deliberately avoided posting or connecting here with so much going on. I just moved back to Texas a few weeks ago. I was up in Lockdown Washington State for medical reasons. My crazy insurance only paid for one  pharmacy on the border in Del Rio. Pharmacy refused any prescriptions except from their clinic which basically had a staff of psychos. I told my dad that May was the month of hell up there. I was right, we got out back to Austin on April 30th. I'm looking to hook up with some OK'ers here. Also, I want to connect with any local HAM clubs. I have two handhelds, need to get my license. I'm staying connected with a group up there in Washington. Good guys! So glad to be back in the Republic of Texas!
Hey I'm back up on here again. We private messaged yesterday in case you forget my name here.
Sheriff is the best way to start things moving. They are elected and the only people that can sidestep state, local and federal power directly. Quickest way to start a county in the right direction.  Short of civil war (violent or not), local power is best since you know your neighbours easily. You can talk with local people with only a minor effort. No Internet connection needed, which is heavily censored.
A recent scientific study shows that the spike protein on Corona-19 is likely catalytic to forming prions. I'll get to what those are below. The mRNA treatment by Pfizer also has the right form of accomplishing the same effect. Getting Corona 19 make cause you to get neuro degenerative diseases. Each dosage further enhances that probability. This is first level work that needs more studies. OK, what is a prion? A good example disease that prion causes is Mad Cow disease. This causes cow's brains to fail. There is a similar disease in humans. Both are caused by prions. A prion is just a protein that is misfolded. When this version encounters the same protein that is correct, it causes it to also misfold. So these prions are just proteins that self-replicate. These are not vaccines being given, they are mRNA instructions to make proteins. Same way your body uses mRNA. DO NOT GET ONE OF THESE! Please!
I dont recognize the name but thats ok. We didnt message yesterday as far as I remember. Whats up
I just wanted you to recognize who I am here. I prefer to keep anything that needs to be kept private over there. Otherwise, here is fine
Prions also cause Chronic Wasting Syndrome.  Name might be familiar to deer hunters in the east.
:wave: :smile: Howdy Chris! welcome 'home' brother!.. i'm about 150+ miles east of Austin in Sheldon
:wave: :smile: Howdy Oathkeeper Patriots!.. we havin fun yet?? gotta line on how to counter the vaccine effects >>> take high dose vitamins C&D3, chaga mushroom tea (i also recommend 'Rooibos' tea) - also run some borax thru yer digestive tract (mix 1/3 to 1/2 teaspoon in water) & drink it up (NOTE: don't mess with the pine needle tea or anything 'pine needle')
they are trying to incapacitate us by ANY MEANS!
the recipe will also thwart effects from exposure to vaccinated people

By the by...you said, "we havin' fun yet?".  Now, if you are going to ask a question like that, you must define the term "fun" to establish a baseline.  I mean, yes, having lots of fun with Dagmar, my inflatable doll.  Does that help establish your baseline? :grin:

@lonestarhog .  Trump's arrest is an eventuality. A foregone conclusion. Expect it. He and family members.

But HOG raises an important question. *What will be the reaction from the public, conservatives, and patriotic Americans when Trump is arrested?*

It would not be wise to arrest Trump. But then again the Left tends to overplay their hand.

:question: Does Anyone Else Remember The Interview About 5-7 Years Ago With SR? :question: 

I don't believe it was with InfoWars, since SR had vacated that program for quite awhile.  It was a radio interview and they were discussing Obozo and the Commies (Dems & Reps) continuing to force inroads into We The People's Rights and proposing/passing unconstitutional oppressive/tyrannical legislation.

Anyways, SR did not mince words, and the result shocked many of us to the core.  He simply warned the Commies (paraphrasing, but almost exact):  You may think that you have protection, but let me warn you that there will be hundreds/thousands of sniper teams operating, and if you think that ONE will not be successful, you are a damn fool.

Anyone remember and/or have more information about the show/quote?

Does the Constitution, expressly or implied, give a person the right to an education?  Well, in Hog's world, NO! However, in the Declaration of Independence, where our Rights are expressed, and arguably in the Bill of Rights, YES!  In my opinion, the expressed Rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness, are the BASIC Rights upon which others exist - like the Right to own firearms supported by ALL THREE of the basic Rights.  I would also argue that under The Common Good, an educated person is a positive contributor to society vs the opposite. So, it may be argued that an INDIVIDUAL does not possess a right to an education, but society does for all its members to formulate and ensure The Common Good.

But, what the hell does a Hog know? Unlike other mammals, we don't even have a Rut.

That‚Äôs why we gotta get protonmail accounts and get on signal asap
Yes a lot of us have been exchanging info this morning Ron
I have signal 4058509903
Glock 36 to a WC 45acp (1911) is a big change in platform. Are you comfortable with the 1911 platform?  Some guys are all about caliber, I'm all about comfort level. The 1911 fits my hand beautifully. It's the narrow grip. Feels amazingly natural.
...If a firearm feels natural in my hand or in my shoulder, everything else I need to do with the firearm comes easy.
Amen very soon
I hated the plastic grips that came with it. I bought some artificial rosewood grips and those are so much better. Yes it‚Äôs comfortable and I am not a big guy. Carry it IWB since it is a full size. The thin width makes it good for that. I just make sure at all times about the safety since it goes against the body it flipping down to be off. But because of the grip safety I am not worried about it going bang for an AD. Feels really good in the hand and a natural pointer for me
When I carry my XD it is wider so I worry more about printing. The 1911 IWB does not print to where the average joe sees it. 
:wave::slight_smile: Howdy Oathkeeper Patriots!.. i forgot all about protonmail!!! great idea! mine is: *HEVi1.0@protonmail.com* - NO more darkness for us!! - i started my contact list with the above emails - will add as more post up!
Rock on, Denbo!
Just proton‚Äôd u...
I will hit you up denbo
Much accomplished today folks, glad to amongst fellow Patriots. I have ALL of your 6‚Äôs when the time comes! 
mine id FN92@protonmail.com
Likewise, Davey
Thanks, FN9.
This is how we start rebuilding, gang.
Yes small steps at first will make it snowball.
And these contacts today have lead to other discussions on other topics so being in these chats IS important. I have learned a lot since the chats have been back up and running since March.  Networking with fellow OKers is as important as what may come 
Hog - i LOVE my gen4 Glock30 - 45ACP, mag carries 10, comes with 2 xtra mags - i also have a Springfield 1911-A1 which is a 6 shot mag BUT it makes a great beat down tool when you get into CQC situations!:laughing:
i'm making a WORD DOC contact list that i can email to the latecomers if they miss the posts here!
I‚Äôm not really particular about what I carry‚Äî- I love ‚Äòem all‚Äî-as long as I can shoot straight, I‚Äôm good.
Thats what i love about the .45ACP Doc - if you hit em anywhere... it frigg'n HURTS!:laughing:
Lol, that‚Äôs right!
ok someone want to clue me in on 'signal' ... never heard of it before today!:rofl:
Outstanding, Denbo.
just try'n to be useful Doc!:rofl:
Yep, it‚Äôs an encrypted app‚Äî- just download it ‚Äî- then we can communicate‚Äî- good to have if this chat ever gets shut down
i'll check it out - downloading now
got it!... now i gotta finger out to use it!:rofl: ... suks being an ole fart! i must be an 'enigma' whatever happened to morse code anyway?:laughing:
i thought i was gonna have to light a fire in the back yard then flap a rug back & forth over it! whodah thunk the dang thing is digitized! :rofl:
Lmao denbo 
Signal is a text app like on an iPhone or Android phone 
Send those smoke signals I still can read them!
ok got my Oathkeeper grp set up - think i sent an invite to Doc Davey & KAZ
we shoulda done this a while back:laughing:
'better late than never'... (my girlfriend used to say):rofl:
hey bros - watching this now - dude is wicked smart! >>> https://www.bitchute.com/video/W4UA7xwjzAan/
Just replied to your Signal
Me too‚Äî- yahoo‚Äî we‚Äôs on fire now boys!
I tripled my contacts in ProtonMail today. That‚Äôs progress boys!
its sooo cute! it sez Oathkeepers - 3 - members:laughing:

guess i gotta head of myself!:rofl:
gotcha lovejoy - i'll shoot you an email - we also have a grp on signal app - i'll send info
Hey Bravo Golf.  I've been quiet for a while...   I have contact with leadership.
with all the infiltration I understand vetting is a big deal... it's not easy
Thank you sir. First name Mike. 
Per DHS:  "The Homeland is facing threats that have evolved significantly and become increasingly complex and volatile in 2021. These threats include those posed by domestic terrorists, individuals and groups engaged in grievance-based violence...."  :laughing:  Grievance-based violence?  Hah! You ain't seen nothin' yet.
WC makes some good stuff from what I‚Äôve experienced. 
Interesting read. The violent speech and   planned actions I‚Äôve seen are on the left, and it‚Äôs not going to stop. A defensive position against these marxists from the honest, law-abiding citizens, the overwhelming majority of which neither hate nor act out, are branded as racist, subversive. We are not the anarchists. We are the ones who work and fuel the economy. The politicians who have fired up the ‚Äúaggrieved‚Äù for their own political purposes have given life to a monster they cannot contain.
Yes they have Redfox. They created this group and like all evil doers they cannot control it like they think they can. They have already started turning on local officials who covered for them all last summer now they are emboldened. Anything we do as seen on multiple videos is considered racist and gets us arrested. What has to happen is force on force. Last man standing scenarios are dangerous and lead to a wrongful arrest. One day they will come across a force equal in size to them with the same and better capabilities. We shall see how that plays out‚Ä¶.
And Good Morning all Oath Keepers!
Good morning NC Oath Keepers. If you do not have a ProtonMail account get one set up and post your email address to the general thread. It is free. Also, get on Signal and using ProtonMail pass on your info. These chats went down the other night because of a server issue not a deplat. We need to insure comms with all OKers work via alternate means!
Good morning SC Oath Keepers. If you do not have a ProtonMail account get one set up and post your email address to the general thread. It is free. Also, get on Signal and using ProtonMail pass on your info. These chats went down the other night because of a server issue not a deplat. We need to insure comms with all OKers work via alternate means!
Posted in the NC and SC threads about getting alternate comms up and running in case we lose these chats. Some on here complain about nothing being done etc etc ad nauseum. Well start by establishing comms with your fellow OKers. It‚Äôs a small thing but important! It is something. Pass on in the other state threads because if we cannot communicate it does not matter what else we do. Yesterday the snowball effect was good so keep pushing it down the hill!
That‚Äôs right, DaveyE7‚Äì spread the word re comms on ur state chat, all!
And a fine morning it is in Georgia too
Good morning from Georgia.  If you are new please go to the top and click on the globe.  That is the Directory. Find your state and introduce yourself!
From what i hear they sent the money, what was sent back didnt work so they just used backups to bring the servers back online.  Not sure how true it is
I heard that also or at the very least what was sent back worked very slowly. But I have been wondering, it is a pipeline and I would think they have manual procedures to keep it flowing. Just fishy the timing and me getting emails from my dimowit Congresswoman patting themselves on the back about doing something, more so then normal. 
Good morning my OK family!
And to add what I said above about the pipeline, one of my work colleagues is retired Army Psy Ops. He ask this whole pipeline thing is classic psyh ops‚Ä¶cause widespread panic, people filling up bags with gasoline. Push them to be more reliant on the government‚Ä¶..makes sense to me
  I'm in psych ops! At least that's what my VA shrink says ;^)
Lol all of could qualify possibly. I can too!
I think I misspelled it
All good
That‚Äôs better lol
I wouldn't be surprised if our own totalitarian government wasn't responsible for that pipeline issue 
I thought that the moment I heard about it 
And the payoff probably lined the Biden crime family's pockets 
Moonshine off topic but we were sharing ProtonMail info on here yesterday and then Signal info via ProtonMail as well. If you feel comfortable doing that then do so so we have back comms with each other. Scroll back a ways to yesterday and you will see a bunch
You know that happened, whether they orchestrated it or not I am sure they made money. ü§¨
There's no way they should fall! But the leadership needs to wake the hell up and get out of New York. As I've said before, they should relocate to one of the zero income tax and most pro gun states, ie. NH or TX.
Look at the payoffs we already know about to them from Russia and Ukraine 
Agreed so that why when I heard ‚ÄúRussian Hackers‚Äù and the hackers swore up and down they had no dealings with the government‚Ä¶..really? 
They are trying to and yes they need a change at the top. Oliver North was the top man for a brief period but LaPierre ousted him and took back over
I joined the NAGR and GOA a while back as well as renewed with the NRA
And now the pipeline is working again. Probably just a test run for something larger, maybe a different medium like food. Prepare folks!
I can't think of the 3 letter abbreviation for the housing organization that pay a fee to so they can tell you what you can and can't do?
Ohhhh my friends at the HOA, with the O standing for Owner!!
:nerd: I have posted this throughout the Internet, to an audience that completely ignores it, including the authors of the missives and videos. It has been sent to NRA, only to be ignored.  (Frustrating!) :confounded: 

The U.S. Constitution - including The Bill of Rights - does not convey, give, grant, nor transfer any of our Natural Rights.  As expressed in The Declaration of Independence - a template for the future U.S. Constitution - "...We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness..." (Note: Not all of our Rights are expressed - only the paramount ones - upon which others are based.)  Our Natural Rights existed throughout Man's History, before there was any form of government. The Right to own firearms is based upon all three of the basic of Life, Liberty, Happiness.  If you have a Right to Life, you have a Right to protect it.  If you have a Right to Liberty, you have a Right to protect it.  If you have a Right to Happiness, you have a Right to ensure it.  Our Founders did not declare our Rights in the Bill of Rights; rather, they PROTECTED our Rights.

There was contentious arguments as to whether or not The Constitution acknowledged and protected our Rights.  In order to get some of the hold-out Colonies to Ratify The Constitution, The Bill of Rights was added.  It did not convey, give, grant, not transfer any Right.  It was written in plain-and-simple language to ensure that there could be no misunderstanding nor misinterpretation.

Simply, the Second Amendment is MOOT.  Take away the Second Amendment and the Right STILL EXISTS!

Never say, "Constitutional Right" or "Second Amendment Right".  Always state "Constitutional Protected Right" or "Second Amendment Protected Right".

Maybe Hamilton was correct when he wrote:  "I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and to the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers not granted; and, on this very account, would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why, for instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretense for claiming that power. They might urge with a semblance of reason, that the Constitution ought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse of an authority which was not given"

Hog :cowboy:
:nerd: I Got Into It With Another Video Author And His Sycophants.  I Posited The Following On Their Question, "What Is Freedom?"

Freedom is not asking permission to live my life as I desire, while understanding that Natural God-Given Rights are NOT My Rights, but Our Rights.  In a society, we all share the God-Given Natural Rights, but we must understand that exercising them as absolute cannot be done in a society of more than one.  Exercising a Right that at that moment infringes on the Rights of others is wrong.  We must all exercise Rights in a responsible manner. For example:  You have the Right to your Life, to live that Life in Liberty, and to do so for Happiness.  However, you cannot endanger my Life, Liberty and Happiness by doing so.  When the Creator endowed us with inalienable/unalienable Rights, He instructed how those Rights may be exercised by providing The Ten Commandments and Scripture.

Hog :cowboy:
Spot in target Hog! Free men do not ask permission but do not infringe on other free men 
Great Hog and spot on. These idiots that debate what is written are dancing around language and bending it to their whims. Hamilton was correct in wondering if it would cause problems and in the case of the Second Amendment it has‚Ä¶
That's for sure!
I am not on signal. What is it?
:gun: I am completely fed-up with listening to the likes of a bunch of black-robed, pseudo-intellectuals, parsing every damn word of our Founding Documents, in an effort to interpret/understand the intent of The Founders.

Let me posit a simple argument that any of those idiots can understand.

"Watch What A Person Does, Rather Than What He Says"

When there was the attempt to confiscate/disarm the Colonists, WHAT WAS THE RESPONSE...not words...KINETIC RESPONSE???  What was The Founders' RESPONSE saying about an individuals Right to own/possess a firearm?  What was the RESPONSE of the Colonists/Founders when their Life, Liberty, Happiness were all put in jeopardy by the British Throne, through General Gage?  Did The Founders call an emergency meeting to PARSE THE WORDING of The Declaration of Independence - the template for the future Constitution?

:clown: :clown: :clown: :clown: :clown: :clown: :clown: :clown: :clown: 
Now, all nine of you can go find something else to PARSE!

Hog :cowboy:
EMERGENCY COMMS!
Just a reminder on the extended or emergency comms subject for those still on gmail, Yahoo, or any common text apps. 
It is highly recommended that we all adopt a protonmail email and utilize Signal for texts and voice calls as both are secure and encrypted but only when both ends of the comm link are on these formats. The encryption is nullified if one end is not following the security protocol!

Grid was down (CA) for several hours yesterday evening
Ron, power grid I assume? For any particular reason or just start of rolling black outs?
Not sure of the cause yet. Some cell service goes down with each power outage. It seems to be a regularly occurring event here...
Bridgeport Sportsman's club, 1pm
I am in Oklahoma if anyone wants me to join them in Signal send me a message 
Let's be frank - when God gave us our free will, he only put *one* law on it : "Do not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil".
It didn't take long for us to fuck *that* up.
Then he tried being a little more specific with the 10 Commandments.  We fucked that up pretty quick too, The tablets were barely cooled before Moses found some breaking them.
The third time around, God tried to "idiot proof" his rules - Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Numbers are full of laws which get broken routinely by Jews and non-Jews alike.
So then God tried doing a hard reset, and went with "Do unto others ..."  And we see how well that's working.

One reason I worked the 11P-7A shift for more than 40 years!  Retired 9 yrs ago, still up until 3-4A, get up ~ 10-11A (sometimes non or later).
i worked a split shift maintenance job @ Bush intercontinental airport air ops weds-sat 6/12/12/12 - 6pm to 6am - loved having half the week off!
Hey, I will need to set a proton today 
Sounds good, I will be setting up a proton today 
I worked 6 on/2 off...every 5th weekend 4 days off.  It is odd, there have been MANY studies of work efficiency since the 1920s.  ALL show that after 6.5 hrs productivity goes down, errors go up, accidents/injuries go up.  And, then, the most critical areas LEO, hospitals (ER, ICU, CCU, etc), etc, go to 12 hour shifts, so people can have "week-ends off"!  Never could understand that.
I worked 3.5 days per week at the hospital, 12 hours for 3 days, 6 on Monday‚Äôs. Every other weekend off. It was a great schedule gave me days off during the week 
Awesome thank you sir
i went in @ midnight on weds to start my week, ended @6am sun morn... i loved workin around the planes, hangin out on the tarmac & 4am cart races!!

        The time has come for a patriot call out. Not some patriots. All patriots. After 4 years of watching most of our representatives in government tie the hands of President Trump and his administration, these corrupt career politicians have finally gone too far. Using the Constitution as a guideline, what we the people have been witnessing is nothing short of a coup. An impeachment, without legal grounds to begin with, one all members of Congress participated in, was more than enough reason to replace these bad government actors. Using a pandemic to conduct an election allowing unverifiable votes sealed their fate. Since all candidates not only went along with this mail-in illegitimate process, but received votes as well, this election has to be considered null and void. THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT!

        Since our mainstream media have evolved from investigative reporting, to tailored political attacks, indoctrination and censorship are the norm for programs carrying national news. Crafting presentations using carefully selected bits of information to portray newsworthy events in the preferred favorable or derogatory light is commonplace. Editorials have been turned into angry rants more than opinion pieces. When the media uses government actors who are paid to deliver party line propaganda, we are witnessing fascism at work. This is not first amendment protected reporting, and it ,too, has to stop.

        The government through the media has been politicizing the pandemic responses, and while creating a climate of fear, they have also overstepped their bounds with unfair and unreasonable restrictions. Rather than cooperate to solve what was viewed as a common problem, authority was used to violate rights more than to define and target core issues. Implementing measures to fight the problem, which was never clearly understood, nor reported, has left an unfocused and inept effort none of us are sure of whatsoever. Stopping the world, under highly suspicious circumstances and reasoning, throwing money away we didn't have for results we find hard to believe, and worse, with no end in sight.

        While governors operated autonomously, the media presented then President Trump as an uncaring buffoon. He was demonized, and considered a bigger threat than the virus. Creating more negative coverage than was ever thought possible, the government used the restrictions and distancing to conduct an unconstitutional election. The judiciary ruled that there wasn't enough proof that the result would have differed, which was not the decision we asked them to make.So with a stolen election, one that amounts to them selecting themselves, they run unchecked to consolidate power. Working to pass legislation no one asked them to produce, the filibuster, 2 new states, and supreme court packing are in the works. Redistricting with more illegal aliens in this country than ever before, and it is plain for all to see the ill intentions of this government gone rogue.

        These people are not representatives of we the people. Independent investigators would find no problem bringing indictments, prosecuting, and sentencing these offenders. So, now is the time for change. THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT isn't just a sentiment, or a movement, it is an actual fact. Allowing people who work for us to steal our authority to then decide our fate, as they see fit, is a disgusting display of arrogance so terribly deceitful there is no need to look any further, or wait any longer. These people must go. With Memorial Day being a national holiday marking the sacrifice of those who gave their lives to create and protect the nation, I can think of no finer way to celebrate it this year than rallying at our state capitols to announce our intentions to stop the steal. Letting those who cheated know what they have done is unacceptable, that THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT, is a message all patriotic citizens need to participate in. I, Christopher E. Wilding, will be in Lansing, Michigan with a message and a bullhorn, 10 AM, so come one, come all. I will be spending the rest of my time this month spreading the message to people in government, law enforcement, military, judiciary, and local, state, and federal representatives. May your position on the governing of this nation determine whether this call out is an invitation or an indictment. See you there!

The Army does a scenario ever so often where they theiritically stop the pipeline...then they see what local resources from areas that are affected can be obtained to alleviate the gas shortage that would occur..gues what they find everytime....there would be mo shortage..except for people hoarding causing this.......recommendation was to keep pioeline trouble  under wraps as much as possible so no hoarding happens...this was definitely a chess move false flag event
Welcome Back to Texas
DaveyE7 & WKNC,

:gun: To Reloaders & Those Who Are Not :gun: 

Years ago I was asked to help establish The Fort Hood Oath Keepers.  We had a Kickoff Meeting and discovered that many were Reloaders.  Since it was a controlled/private meeting I discussed what I call:  _Offensive & Defensive Reloading Tactics_.  Anyways, they were all shocked :zap: - shocked, I tell ya :astonished: - and expressed plans to incorporate the tactics.

Would anyone be interested in having a Signal meeting - now that I am allowed in :cry: - to discuss and determine any level of interest?  Yes, you do not have to personally be a Reloader.

Don't worry about offending me by saying, "NO!".  Hogs have thick skins - beautiful, healthy, radiant skins - but thick. :pig:

I have a question. Wasn't it you that said you were living on your Social Security? But you work nights at the air field? 

Hi windy,
How was your move to Florida? 
I hope all went smoothly! 
How goes the battle down there in Panama City? Do you have a good number of active members? 
I've been pressing hard for alternate and fully encrypted comms between our members. We must prepare for the inevitable takedown of our chat again. And going fully encrypted is an obvious bonus! 
Today I reached out to 9 states in reference to expanding our comms.
The 6 New England states and then NY, NJ, & PA. I'm hopeful that this will serve to bring us closer together, boost our training regiments and also help to build our numbers.
Don't be a stranger! 
Your brother in arms,
Gary

We all know that multiple alphabet agencies are spying on us (but the Fn post office monitoring social media? That has what to do with delivering mail?). Biden (will never use his name and president in the same breath) wants to double the size of the IRS. Anyone who has ever bumped heads with them knows how much power they have. JMHO, but the IRS will become the new Gestapo.

Morning Moonshine,
I beat myself up working around the house yesterday. Guess I needed a bit more sleep than normal.
Getn old's a bitch!
Hey Moonshine, 
I'm not. I'm behind enemy lines in the Boston area. Damnd shame what's happened to this place politically! Hell our National Guard was the first, Paul Revere and the Freedom Trail and the the Boston Tea Party!
I'm hoping that soon I'll be healed up from a couple of injuries I'm recovering from to be able to jump in my RV and go where most needed around our Country.  FN9 has asked that I come help out in NV. But I had to decline for the time being being in rough shape!
I've jumped on a number of different states chat pages, some where we suffered the greatest injustice in "the steel", some where I have buddies, like DaveyE7 in NC, KAZ or Keeping.AZ in AZ and windy who just moved from AZ to FL and then the six New England states because I'm trying to build our numbers here as well as our emergency and encrypted comms of which I have been a driving force.
I can't stress enough how important it is that we get on the encrypted sites protonmail and Signal! And building our emergency communications. Just look at last week when our chat server went down for tech issues! The alphabet boys could hit this service and in a blink and many of us would be out of contact with our brothers and sisters. 
You tell'em Big Dave! This has never been more important!

He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of Yahweh, He is my refuge and my fortress. My Elohim, in him will I trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence.

He shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night: nor for the arrow that flieth by day. Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.

A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. Because thou hast made Yahweh, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;

There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For he shall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

He shall call upon me and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him. With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

I watched the video of Dr T and 3 other Dr‚Äôs and a nurse talking about that. Makes sense to me and what the one Dr said about EMF and taking readings in their office just off their cell phones! Agreed quarantine time and monitoring and hopefully one day figure out how to reverse it or neutralize it. Nope still not getting it
Dr. T-P is 100% correct, along with 100's of other medical pros & research scientists - the jab is 100% deadly... whether you get stabbed with it or NOT!!
We went to Gatlinburg and we were in crowds the first day due to rain. I am convinced now that I watched that video that we all came home sick because of that. IMHO
i can help you alleviate any symptoms you & the fam may have - send me an email with listed issues & i'll give you the natural remedies to fix it
Good morning, OKs!

:poop: Windham New Hampshire Ballot Audit Finds Folded Ballots Generated False Results :poop: 

_During the first small audit (recount) it was discovered that Republican votes were undercounted and Democrat candidates were overcounted. This anomaly was discovered during a hand recount of the ballots as compared to the electronic tabulation results. After the first set of tabulation results were discovered to be inaccurate the state authorized a full forensic audit.  The full audit is ongoing,..._

I havnt been on in a few days as well.  Each spring i pressure wash the house and porches.  So i am beat up too and my brain roasted from the sun lol.  Northing you said in chat i disagree with at all.  We are in difficult times. 1-6 really hit us hard here in Georgia and at a time we were really taking off.  So kind of reforming now and thing are looking up finally
Morning Chris,
I'm ssgtgman on OK, aka Gary Landers. 
windy, Krissy said I should reach out to you in MI. She said we were like minded! üò≥
Not sure if you're aware but things didn't work out for her in Fl. She's on the road headed to AZ. Holding up in a hotel in Louisiana at present. Awaiting aid from the troops, KAZ and the AZ network. 
She's fallen on hard times with the covid  economy. KAZ has started the initial boot up of a GSG fund for her. Hopefully that will be established today. 
You can reach me at ssgtgman@protonmail.com and I will give you my # for Signal comms.
Duty Honor Country, 
Gary
Yes that was a gut punch and a kick in the balls simultaneously! 
Now it's very difficult to get the much needed backup comms going as understandably the troops are skittish! But without it we are too easily cut off at the knees! 
I don't know about you but I'm 61, 100%p&t and any work I do around the homestead usually ends up with me on ice and hunched ober.
Over,  My thumbs are dyslexic! 
I agree whole new election with National Guard and active duty watching over. And yes little asshat joe couldn‚Äôt win dog catcher!
We sent emails to everyone in our list. Explaining, encouraging...than 2 of our guys who went to DC-but were not even close to the Capitol-got visited by the FBI.  That put us back but i was able to turn it around and show the  members that nobody was arrested, no leadership contacted, that the FBI talked some than left and thats all so we are in the clear.  So really the past few months have been gathering what flock we have left and working on moral and team building.
For sure the long train of "freebies" is coming. AKA buying votes!
We are all good they didn‚Äôt last long at all. Short cold, no fever. Thanks denbo!!!
I just turned 50.  Broke back in Army, surgeries, fusions, ect ect.  i can understand. I saved and got the Stem cell/PRP injections in my disks and spine 2 months ago.  It has had an amazing result.    I do Singal on my PC.  my typing and grammar it aint so good lol
Good deal! I am and always have been the one to run towards the fire. I did my first 6 in the Army in the early 80s then no service till after 9/11 and I had to sign back up. Same here. I only just got involved after witnessing the injustice that was being perpetrated on the conservative groups like 3%rs, PBs, & OKs as the scum ant and blm were having charges dismissed or no charges at all. So I came a running. But it's been a ghost town for a while! 
If it appears the rules have changed its because they have.  WE are the targets now. We have to realize this and operate in a new reality.
Audit now in Ga too!  Left has learned lessons with the one in Arizona so we expect every resource they have to pour into Georgia to stop it.

thanks for the reminder of the memories bro! ...i can Robin Williams yellin in my head!:rofl:
And I never said good morning so Good Afternoon all Oath Keepers! Reminder get on ProtonMail and Signal for emergency comms and connect with everyone. Post your ProtonMail here then pass Signal contact thru ProtonMail. Opsec people!
How do you get on signal? I'm on proton mail.
Or if I had your # I could have sent you an invitation to join signal.
https://www.signal.org
The other way is when someone has your number who is already on Signal, that person can send you an invitation to join.
You have a good night 
Gary
emailed you Ricky - search my # on signal app & i'll bring you in
It damnd well never should've been allowed in the first place. The permittance of this mob rule hysteria was part of the radical left's plan to dissolve our culture and our society into a racist bombshell just waiting for it to burst so that this tyrannical government can install Martial Law upon us, stripping away our freedoms to the brink of extinction!
You tell'em DaveyE7, and you tell'em good!
agree bro! tomorrow is the last day of legislative session so they have to go highspeed to get everything to the Govnr by tomorrow night midnight - i got little trust for those RHINOS in Austin
Or for RINOs anywhere! They should be part of a disappearing act, if you catch my drift!
Guys...let's be vigilant about posting ANYONE'S personal contact info here without their express permission.  It's just a chat but OPSEC is essential.  Prying ABC eyes and unvetted folks are here. We need to protect each other's info as much as we should protect our own.  Share in private if you choose but let's  keep it out of the public chats  Thanks!
Good morning all Oath Keeper brothers and sisters!
Good morning DaveyE7 and to all my of my OKr family!
Lol nice one ssgtgman!
Good morning Patriots!

The C-130 has been used to deliver bombs like the MOAB.  However, it is nice to see that they have considered not igniting the missiles until "Once an accelerometer detects the pallet is clear of the plane and in free fall..."

I wonder if they learned this from Murphy's Law on initial test. :grin:

Hog :cowboy:
MOAB the Daisy Cutter!
Love the C130! The mighty Herc!
I hated that plane in 1968 because it took us 'in country'.  One year later it was the most beautiful plane as it landed to take us 'out of country'.  I have loved it ever since.

Hog :cowboy:
C-130s kick-ass
One of my friends - a retired Delta Captain - flew the C130s.  In April 1975 he was flying Vietnamese interpreters, etc. out of Saigon, as it was falling.  The choppers would deliver the evacuees to the airport and he would leave and return.  He loves that plane, as I am sure those evacuees do, too.

Hog :cowboy:
I hated it until I worked on it. Almost got killed in one in a near miss mid air collision. Will forever love that airplane as I do the F4, F16‚Ä¶
THREE HOLY MEN AND THE BEAR:

A Catholic Priest, a Baptist Preacher and a Rabbi all served as Chaplains to the students of Northern Michigan University at Marquette in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  They would get together two or three times a week for coffee and to talk shop.

One day, someone made the comment that preaching to people isn't really all that hard, a real challenge would be to preach to a bear.  One thing led to another, and they decided to do an experiment.  They would all go out into the woods, find a bear, preach to it, and attempt to convert it to their religion.

Seven days later, they all came together to discuss their experiences.  

Father Flannery, who had his arm in a sling, was on crutches, and had various bandages on his body and limbs, went first.  'Well,' he said, 'I went into the woods to find me a bear.  And when I found him, I began to read to him from the Catechism.  Well, that bear wanted nothing to do with me and began to slap me around.  So I quickly grabbed my holy water, sprinkled him and said, ‚ÄòHoly Mary Mother of God‚Äô ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and he became as gentle as a lamb.  The Bishop is coming out next week to give him first communion and confirmation.‚Äù

Reverend Billy Bob spoke next.  He was in a wheelchair, had one arm and both legs in casts, and had an IV drip.  In his best fire-and-brimstone oratory, he exclaimed, 'WELL, brothers, you KNOW that we Baptists don't sprinkle!  I went out and I FOUND me a bear.  And then I began to read to my bear from God's HOLY WORD!  But that bear wanted nothing to do with me.  So I took HOLD of him and we began to wrestle.  We wrestled down one hill, UP another and DOWN another until we came to a creek.  So I quickly DUNKED him and BAPTIZED his hairy soul.  And just like you said, he became as gentle as a lamb.  We spent the rest of the day praising Jesus.  Hallelujah!‚Äù

The Priest and the Reverend both looked down at the Rabbi, who was lying in a hospital bed.  He was in a body cast and traction with IVs and monitors running in and out of him.  He was in really bad shape...
 

The Rabbi looked up and said, "Looking back on it, circumcision may not have been the best way to start.":rofl:
the 'new & improved'... Puff the Magic Dragon!! - those AC's are brutal!!

If you have a case of beer and you want some company, NEVER invite one Baptist.  Always invite two or more.  If you invite only one, he will drink all your beer. :shushing_face:

The Texas Senate just voted to pass the Conference Committee Report on HB 1927 (Constitutional Carry). It's been a long eight years for us working on Constitutional Carry and it's finally going to be a reality in Texas. We expect the bill could be signed by the Governor as early as this week.

Phantom is legit, GA has vetted him. 
Same here, Haven't been on with all that's on going.
Good morning all Oath Keepers
Dems said they are fighting a war against is. They TOLD us this a few years ago.  Its been our GOP which ignored it and rolled over for them at every opportunity
And we have met him personally.
Good morning
Remember if you are new please go to the top, click on the globe which is our directory and find your state than introduce yourself.
Phantom is not a mole.
Since 1-6 he has taken the whole state on his own in addition to a very busy life.   We DM'ed him
And in addition to finding you state, get on ProtonMail and Signal for emergency comms. We have been exchanging info since the problems with the chats not too long ago!
Good morn to all!
The GOP has been a big letdown for quite some time.
On the other hand the demorats have had and been lazer focused on their sinister plans!
That's awesome!
Good morning Doc, and to all OKs!
And hey, Congratulations Texas! 
rylandrebel Yes sorry for the delay.
Good morning to all OK in Sunshine State!!!!
Man I am sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you.  We will get this going today.

what you face is merely a rough passing... our free will will always put us in position of 'choice' - this is HIS way of keep our minds 'Spiritually tight' for HIM!! our 'choice is: do we dig in & build ferociously on our Faith or do we allow the weakness of our flesh to override the Spirit? Just as HE will NEVER abandon you, neither will i... give in ONLY to the Glory HE pours out upon you & KNOW HIS Angels surround your every move & lift you up in every thought! i sense you have NO quitting in you... this too is a gift that is required to obtain victory!!
trust completely in HE whom i serve!! if you are 'locked on' you are invincible & NO darkness can touch you!!
My prayers are with you, that you too will be strengthened to the end
Your prophecy is clear
Truly inspirational. Glory to God in the HIghest ‚úö
https://youtu.be/p33I3x7HgYE
Lordy lordy! I guess i can see why....lol Tops the list of very bad ideas!
a HUGE logistical pain in the butt for sure!:laughing: ...you have to wonder how the troops that worked around the gun & handled the ammo faired?? my bet, they all died of cancer (the nasty cancer on steroids' type!!)
No one is going to ever force me to wear a mask. The very symbol of tyranny (if not the actual Mark of the Beast). This medical terrorism must end. As of today, I have now been denied care by the VA's in Colorado and Florida...over a damned ChiCom mask! They truly care more about masks (and their beloved Gates-Fauci poison) than people, which to me is the very definition of evil. I am currently awaiting the verdict on my final efforts to obtain care through the Texas VA. This is outright genocide. If we don't fight them now, next they'll be cutting off our our food, gas and comms, and it will be too late. We will have submitted to our own slavery, without so much as wimper. 

Friends, I ask your prayers, both for my own strength to continue fighting, as well as for our countrymen to awaken NOW from their deep brainwashed slumber, and rise up against the Beast. There are only two parties left:  Patriots and Tyrants. There is no middle ground or grey area between the two. Our silence is deafening, and only provides aid and comfort to the enemy. We must act while we still can.

"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"
--Mark 8:36
:mask: From the inception of this Covid-19 hoax, I have refused to partake of the lunacy. I have a box of N95 masks in my workshop, and read the manufacturer's comments/instructions when purchased about six years ago.  My old box states that the mask will not prevent the reception nor transmission of a virus and other foreign substances of particular sizes.

I assessed the effectiveness of Social Distancing and laughed at its stupidity.

No propaganda from the Covid Task Force, nor their lackeys in the Marxist State Media (MSM) was given credence. Information was garnered directly from sources like The New England Journal of Medicine, The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, Frontline Doctors, etc. A plethora of available, credible, and empirical data/information for any individual interested in taking responsibility for his/her own health and well-being. This included an assessment of my daily all-natural vitamins/minerals, which resulted in a minor increase in certain ones like Timed Release Vitamin-C Complex 1000mg.

As the social pressure and lunacy increased and attempted to engulf me, cognitive awareness piqued as a limited number of others stood their ground and refused Da Diaper and Da Distance.

Retail establishments displayed signs such as "Masks Mandatory", "Face Covering Required", "Respect Social Distancing", etc. This included places that I frequently patronized like HEB, Home Depot, Lowes, Walmart, Walgreens, Discount Tire, AT&T Store, etc.  Signs were ignored and my normal shopping continued.

I was only challenged twice:  1) HEB had a 'greeter' at the door with masks who inquired if I have or require a mask.  I simply stated, "No!  I have not required a diaper for 73-years on one end, and definitely refuse to diaper another end. Thank you for asking." 2) Walgreens cashier stopped me upon entering and requested that I wear a mask for the safety of others.  I politely stated, "If all of you can pretend that those diapers are keeping you safe, then you can pretend that I am wearing one. Thank you for your concern."  I was never approached by a male nor female Karen during any of my public daily activities. (A few friends told me, "You don't look approachable." :face_with_raised_eyebrow: )

Point of this chronicle, presented in mind-numbing verbosity, is to test the reader's ability to endure mental/physical discomfort, and not seek the relief afforded by certain liquid spirits or pharmaceuticals.

Thank you for your attention and interest.

Hog :cowboy:
@rylandrebel  DM denbo for an invite.
My comment is simple:  Real President Donald J. Trump and the Patriots are working to restore The Constitutional Republic.  I await the results and orders from THE Command--In-Chief.  

I wrote a What If missive positing how President Trump can/will resume his political office in a Constitutional way with no military involvement nor any civil war.

What if Trump is focused on the 2022 elections, and does nothing...

What if it is a Republican massacre and they virtually own the House/Senate?

What if the House elects Trump as The Speaker? (The Constitution does not require that The Speaker be an elected member of Congress)

What if Speaker Trump aggressively moves to Impeach/Remove Biden and Harris? (Lots of crimes easily proven)

What if Speaker Trump then becomes President until 2024 when he is officially elected for a legal second term?

Speaker Trump would be more powerful than President Sniffer.

The Speaker being 3rd in line for the presidency could be accomplished in a matter of months.

All Constitutional and no need for military nor civil war.
@lonestarhog I totally respect your opinion  (held by  millions of other patriots, no doubt, and which I myself shared until recently). However, the electoral process has clearly failed, all three branches of government are irredeemably corrupt, and Real Donald J. Trump's power has been neutralized by whatever powers are took him out of the game in November. While I would love to think President Trump can save us (and perhaps he will be able to make a contribution at some point in the future). But the harsh reality we must face, is that he can't. I'm not a Trump cultist. My loyalty is to the Constitution and Liberty alone. The responsibility our Founders gave up has been triggered, and it is squarely on our shoulders now to step up and restore the Republic, with or without the President's encouragement.
Analyzing what is presently transpiring with the Audits, and the writings of President Trump, there is absolutely no need for any kinetic action(s).  This is being resolved in a lawful and Constitutional manner, which is what President Trump always touted.  I firmly believe in him and his lawful tactics.
I must respectfully disagree. This is not the time for us to sleep. I can no longer support or live under a surveillance terror regime that mandates its citizens to carry out a medical genocide, if there is no one who will stand with me in fighting them. Who really won the election is totally irrelevant at that point. Immediate, concerted action is what is needed now (whether "kinetic" or otherwise effective, narrative-changing action. What else is the point of this organization, if we are not willing to act when our call to duty is clear. That is the meaning of "patriotism" to me). If waiting for Godot is our true mission here, then we wait to America's peril.
Many of us disagreed with this missive when it was first published, and do so today.

The Constitution given to us by The Founders is working as designed, just not for immediate gratification as wished by the author, et al.
I agree w Lonestar. We are about the Constitution, Law and order, process and debate‚Äî- we are NOT anarchists. 
:flag_um: Windy, some of you need to understand the difference between a Patriot who loves his/her Country, the Constitution, and The Rule of Law, and an Anarchist (e.g. BLM, ANTIFA, et al).

Hog :cowboy:
@Redfox I hear you, but why not follow our Constitutional obligations to abolish this corrupt government. Must I remind my brothers and sisters once again:

"When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world."

Even more valid today than it was when it was penned, for today we face an existential crisis which threatens humanity, not just our national liberty.
Agree, Lonestar.
I don't know what windy is talking about! I think she may be a few screws short!
@ssgtgman Cheap shot, Gary. I wouldn't have expected that from you. Reminds me of what they called Goldwater and Reagan in the early days of the conservative movement. We must rise to a higher level of discourse than that. Its just called speaking the truth and standing up for liberty. Presumably what we are fighting for.....
Windy, we are very familiar with many of our Founding Documents, and can recite them without a visual aid, this includes other loved documents like The Gettysburg Address.

You are entitled to your interpretation, but please do not attribute it to others.  Projection is for the enemy, not us.

I don't know where this is all coming from windy! 
@ssgtgman Love of country and loyalty to my Oath. Can you not accept what has happened, and the responsibility we have?
Roger that Hog and perfectly stated!
@lonestarhog Then we must simply agree to disagree. I project nothing. I state facts only, a rare phenomena in this day and age, I will say. The only question is, will you respect my standpoint. If not, then I officially tender my resignation from the organization, sending you my blessings for good luck with your strategy which is doomed.
Windy this type of inflammatory rhetoric is not appropriate for this forum.  Especially when you put targets on members.  I will be deleting the above posts.   If you want to "Gin up the troops" start your own site.
@FN9 Fair enough. I tried my best. I hereby resign from the Oath Keepers.
Windy, you are entitled to your 'opinion', and not your own 'beliefs' stated as "facts".

"Facts" are something upon which we all agree, due to them being proven empirical through research and vetting.

Hog :cowboy:
I think its time for WE THE PEOPLE to revolt, with whatever numbers we may have. Way past time. Quite aside from the fact that it is our clear duty as stated in The Declaration of Independence, I just can't watch this happening to my country and not do everything within my power to stop it. I joined this organization with the prayer that you, my brother and sister patriots, would feel the same. We have been paralyzed by nothing more than our fears, and we must snap out of it quickly if we do not want to be slaves. What say you to this coming Memorial Day, Sunday, May 31st?

We know in our hearts and consciences what we are obligated by our Oaths to do (as well as the price we will pay for failure to act accordingly). Its time! @wildman1959 has laid the groundwork with his *THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT* manifesto. Its a solid document based in the spirit and values of our Founders. @ssgtgman has an outstanding plan for upping out game on comms. And others here I have spoken to possess the will and courage to lead, if we will let them, and stand behind them with our lives. We can do this!

I am betting over half the military would side with us once we set the stage and lit the initial spark. Also, I know that hard-core right-wing nationalist forces have been waiting in the wings, for a sign and itching to join us in the fight. I would be willing be among that group executing such a well-coordinated strike (beyond symbolic) against our enemy that would shake their complacency and ignite the spark we need.

*THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT*
*By @wildman1959*
*May 2, 2021*

The time has come for a patriot call out. Not some patriots. All patriots. After 4 years of watching most of our representatives in government tie the hands of President Trump and his administration, these corrupt career politicians have finally gone too far. Using the Constitution as a guideline, what we the people have been witnessing is nothing short of a coup. An impeachment, without legal grounds to begin with, one all members of Congress participated in, was more than enough reason to replace these bad government actors. Using a pandemic to conduct an election allowing unverifiable votes sealed their fate. Since all candidates not only went along with this mail-in illegitimate process, but received votes as well, this election has to be considered null and void. THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT!

        Since our mainstream media have evolved from investigative reporting, to tailored political attacks, indoctrination and censorship are the norm for programs carrying national news. Crafting presentations using carefully selected bits of information to portray newsworthy events in the preferred favorable or derogatory light is commonplace. Editorials have been turned into angry rants more than opinion pieces. When the media uses government actors who are paid to deliver party line propaganda, we are witnessing fascism at work. This is not first amendment protected reporting, and it ,too, has to stop.

        The government through the media has been politicizing the pandemic responses, and while creating a climate of fear, they have also overstepped their bounds with unfair and unreasonable restrictions. Rather than cooperate to solve what was viewed as a common problem, authority was used to violate rights more than to define and target core issues. Implementing measures to fight the problem, which was never clearly understood, nor reported, has left an unfocused and inept effort none of us are sure of whatsoever. Stopping the world, under highly suspicious circumstances and reasoning, throwing money away we didn't have for results we find hard to believe, and worse, with no end in sight.

        While governors operated autonomously, the media presented then President Trump as an uncaring buffoon. He was demonized, and considered a bigger threat than the virus. Creating more negative coverage than was ever thought possible, the government used the restrictions and distancing to conduct an unconstitutional election. The judiciary ruled that there wasn't enough proof that the result would have differed, which was not the decision we asked them to make.So with a stolen election, one that amounts to them selecting themselves, they run unchecked to consolidate power. Working to pass legislation no one asked them to produce, the filibuster, 2 new states, and supreme court packing are in the works. Redistricting with more illegal aliens in this country than ever before, and it is plain for all to see the ill intentions of this government gone rogue.

        These people are not representatives of we the people. Independent investigators would find no problem bringing indictments, prosecuting, and sentencing these offenders. So, now is the time for change. THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT isn't just a sentiment, or a movement, it is an actual fact. Allowing people who work for us to steal our authority to then decide our fate, as they see fit, is a disgusting display of arrogance so terribly deceitful there is no need to look any further, or wait any longer. These people must go. With Memorial Day being a national holiday marking the sacrifice of those who gave their lives to create and protect the nation, I can think of no finer way to celebrate it this year than rallying at our state capitols to announce our intentions to stop the steal. Letting those who cheated know what they have done is unacceptable, that THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT, is a message all patriotic citizens need to participate in. I, Christopher E. Wilding, will be in Lansing, Michigan with a message and a bullhorn, 10 AM, so come one, come all. I will be spending the rest of my time this month spreading the message to people in government, law enforcement, military, judiciary, and local, state, and federal representatives. May your position on the governing of this nation determine whether this call out is an invitation or an indictment. See you there!
To my faithful brothers and sisters here. I apologize for my flipped remark on our chat regarding the current issue. I let go without adequate restraint. I'll do better.
No worries
All above is relevant. Numbers are important. We must act as one nation in a coordinated effort with a definable strategy, tactics and timetable (not just OK, although OK can be leaders/trainers among the citizenry). This cohesion of We the People must take place!  We must not be picked off one at a time. We need a leader who will lay out the call to action that everyone can see and will be able to take actionable steps Every person has a skill or talent to contribute and will need coordination in each location, from the bottom up. I am keeping my eye out for the starting bell that fast approaches, Be prepared and stand ready to not just hold our ground but take back what has been stolen from We the People. IMHO
I answer to Lonestarhog, some people need to pull their thumbs out of their asses to release what amounts to nothing more than hot air. Patriots  stand up for and fight for freedom at every turn, not at their convenience. Without responsibility, integrity doesn't exist. getting rid of unconstitutional government actors is not anarchy, it is the duty of every citizen. American Government- where great capacities of human invention have bet set for a century on devising systems utterly invulnerable to reform. Patience can be a virtue. It can also be a waste of valuable time and quite stupid, depends what you are waiting for. Situations dictate.So... we have everyone in government, judiciary included, supporting an election and the results, one that should have never been held in the first place, after all of Congress voted in an impeachment that should have never took place,again, every one complicit. Now creating states, votes, court packing, all moves to consolidate power for themselves against us, none we asked for, all decided for us. After politicizing a pandemic response if not outright releasing it to begin with...? A government gone rogue, who answer to themselves ,and decide for us. I'm certainly Constitutional, fairly conservative, but nowhere goddamn near fucking brain dead..... I'll continue to work with THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT until there is one worth recognizing. I'm not seeing one!
Good morning Patriots!

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
I too am also vulnerable to taking harsh actions when emotions run high. Knowing when to lash out and when to lay low can be difficult when emotions run out of control...
I believe that we all have the ability to take some kind of action locally in one way or another. Be it with a bull horn to share the truth of this situation or standing guard over those with the bull horn. Look for what can be done in the home front until the time to amass the troops.
Wildman ,  We are all aware of the current situation.  We are also aware of Constitutional duty.  What we are not here for is to incite violence and anarchy.  Patriots, including OathKeepers already have targets on our backs.  Provoking an escalation is not safe or sound for anyone.  This is NOT the place to do it.
To Wildman1959:  The fallacy of your insult posited as a patriotic argument is that The Founders did not have Constitutional Parameters and the support of that Document.  They left us with the tools to resolve any situation and remain within the parameters and with the support of The Constitution.  That Document has not failed us, as it is still in effect and being utilized by President Trump and the Patriots.  

Yes, they left us with the words of The Declaration of Independence, and when the circumstances are right those words may become action(s).  However, lawful avenues are being pursued, with some transitory diversions, but moving in a positive (Constitutional) direction.

Hog :cowboy:
AMEN HOG!!!
Agree with Ron and Hog.  We can and should stand up locally but that doesn't mean tossing this org and it's members under the ABC bus to do it.
Well said, FN9 and Hog.
We are making headway!    https://flashpoint.govictory.com/episode/a-major-victory-sam-sorbo-lance-wallnau-hank-kunneman-and-more-may-18th-2021/
wildman1959 - here's a thought!!! try getting involved in the local political scene - there are many opportunities to make your voice heard, try local election boards, GOP party chairs, join the convention of states action committee... it's free, it works & it will keep you from being locked up for making public threats :wink:
Stewart was right. Trump had 18 million veterans, not 35000 Oath Keeper members at his beck and call, with many millions more even more willing than some of them, diligently waiting in the wings. And did nothing. I will never take away from all he has done, though, being honest, he scores zero points for dropping that ball on Jan.6. We can't trust anyone in this government as far as you can throw them, and if you see something different that is wishful thinking. Waiting for something Constitutional to materialize from purchased politicians corrupted by power they disregarded the Constitution to create, is so far beyond hopeful to imagine it, must less believe it, remains more incomprehensible than any action taken to thwart their efforts.
This is an honorable organization. I would not have stayed a part of it if I thought or felt otherwise. I am tired of our name being dragged through the mud for no reason. I will not further dishonor our organization by any further mudslinging. I leave that to those who do that when they cannot do or say anything else. 
:book: *To Fellow OK Patriots On Honoring Your Oath, From An Ol' Hog* :pig:

*Article II, Section 1, Clause 8 - The Presidential Oath of Office:*

"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."

*The Oath of Enlistment - Enlisted:*

"I, _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God."

*The Oath of Office - Officers:*

"I, _____ (SSAN), having been appointed an officer in the _____ (Military Branch) of the United States, as indicated above in the grade of _____ do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign or domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter; So help me God."

Notice a slight difference between the President's Oath and the Enlisted/Officer Oath, that being:  "...all enemies, foreign or domestic...?

Now, why would The Founders not have included this simple phrase?

In this Hog's opinion, it is the President who identifies who is/are "enemies, foreign or domestic".  Until these are identified and classified as such, the Military/Patriots remain ready for orders from their TRUE President.  In other words, these entities are not identified/defined by anyone other than the TRUE President, and certainly not officially by the Military/Patriots.  Any independent action(s) taken by the Military/Patriots will not be Constitutional, nor fidelity to our Oath.

Also, a grave Constitutional misunderstanding is that the President is the Commander-In-Chief upon taking the Oath of Office. 

Our Founders put the Military under direct control of the Congress. (e.g. All financial support comes from Congress.  All Generals are established and promoted by Congressional authority. Etc.) Why not direct control by the President?  Because they experienced what occurs when kings have and control armies.

When Congress declares a State of War, the President is given direct control of the Military and is made the Commander-In-Chief, for the duration of the State of War.  Subsequently, the title of Commander-In-Chief is withdrawn.  (Yeah, I know, what is supposed to be a Constitutional process and what the clowns have bastardized are two different things, sadly to say.)

Please consider this when deciding what is fidelity to your Oath.

Just the opinion of an ol' Hog.

For The Constitutional Republic Pre-1871,

Part 2
lonestarhog6:58 AM        My comment is simple: Real President Donald J. Trump and the Patriots are working to restore The Constitutional Republic. I await the results and orders from THE Command--In-Chief.

I wrote a What If missive positing how President Trump can/will resume his political office in a Constitutional way with no military involvement nor any civil war.

What if Trump is focused on the 2022 elections, and does nothing...

What if it is a Republican massacre and they virtually own the House/Senate?

What if the House elects Trump as The Speaker? (The Constitution does not require that The Speaker be an elected member of Congress)

What if Speaker Trump aggressively moves to Impeach/Remove Biden and Harris? (Lots of crimes easily proven)

What if Speaker Trump then becomes President until 2024 when he is officially elected for a legal second term?

Speaker Trump would be more powerful than President Sniffer.

The Speaker being 3rd in line for the presidency could be accomplished in a matter of months.

All Constitutional and no need for military nor civil war.
Part 3
windy7:06 AM
lonestarhog I totally respect your opinion (held by millions of other patriots, no doubt, and which I myself shared until recently). However, the electoral process has clearly failed, all three branches of government are irredeemably corrupt, and Real Donald J. Trump's power has been neutralized by whatever powers are took him out of the game in November. While I would love to think President Trump can save us (and perhaps he will be able to make a contribution at some point in the future). But the harsh reality we must face, is that he can't. I'm not a Trump cultist. My loyalty is to the Constitution and Liberty alone. The responsibility our Founders gave up has been triggered, and it is squarely on our shoulders now to step up and restore the Republic, with or without the President's encouragement.
Part 4
lonestarhog7:09 AM
Analyzing what is presently transpiring with the Audits, and the writings of President Trump, there is absolutely no need for any kinetic action(s). This is being resolved in a lawful and Constitutional manner, which is what President Trump always touted. I firmly believe in him and his lawful tactics.
üéØ 1
windy7:11 AM
I must respectfully disagree. This is not the time for us to sleep. I can no longer support or live under a surveillance terror regime that mandates its citizens to carry out a medical genocide, if there is no one who will stand with me in fighting them. Who really won the election is totally irrelevant at that point. Immediate, concerted action is what is needed now (whether "kinetic" or otherwise effective, narrative-changing action. What else is the point of this organization, if we are not willing to act when our call to duty is clear. That is the meaning of "patriotism" to me). If waiting for Godot is our true mission here, then we wait to America's peril.

Good morning!
Exactly.  Now we have Ryan running his mouth.  It was on his and others watch the Dems were allowed to do anything they please
Have you now?
Saw they picked up another guy in FL.  Media keeps saying we are anti-government and anti-Democracy.  Its furthest from the truth really.  I dont know about Boson but here in Georgia most of our memebers-whats left-are 50 and over! Bad knees and backs.  Hardly a threat to Democracy lol
yut yut
Dod you know that Paul Ryan became a member of the board of Fox News after leaving politics. It just so happens to coincide with the turning of Fox into a puppet of the left!
just another running day bro
Yes, and some other shady positions too.  Cant remember off hand but on boards.  A worm
I was thinking, loads of marines and sailors here
seems the naval services have more discipline and patriotism

https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/news-nation/memorial-day-flag-to-fly-upside-down   https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/world/italy-facing-civil-war-as-prime-minister-orders-vaccines-to-be-mandatory-for-all
@Ron  Thanks for the heads up on the flag this Memorial Day.  Warms my heart and breaks my heart. It's a grand idea.
When displaying the flag, DO the following:

Display the U.S. flag from sunrise to sunset on buildings and stationary flagstaffs in the open. When a patriotic effect is desired the flag may be displayed 24-hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of darkness.
When placed on a single staff or lanyard, place the U.S. Flag above all other flags.
When flags are displayed in a row, the U.S. flag goes to the observer‚Äôs left. Flags of other nations are flown at same height. State and local flags are traditionally flown lower.
When used during a marching ceremony or parade with other flags, the U.S. Flag will be to the observer‚Äôs left.
On special days, the flag may be flown at half-staff. On Memorial Day it is flown at half-staff until noon and then raised.
When flown at half-staff, should be first hoisted to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff position. The flag should be again raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day. By "half-staff" is meant lowering the flag to one-half the distance between the top and bottom of the staff.
When the flag is displayed over the middle of the street, it should be suspended vertically with the union (blue field of stars) to the north in an east and west street or to the east in a north and south street.
When placed on a podium the flag should be placed on the speaker‚Äôs right or the staging area. Other flags should be placed to the left.
When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall (or other flat surface), the union (blue field of stars) should be uppermost and to the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left.
When displayed in a window it should be displayed in the same way -- with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the street.
When the flag is displayed on a car, the staff shall be fixed firmly to the chassis or clamped to the right fender.
When the flag is used to cover a casket, it should be so placed that the union is at the head and over the left shoulder. The flag should not be lowered into the grave or allowed to touch the ground.
When saluting the flag DO the following:

All persons present in uniform (military, police, fire, etc.) should render the military salute. Members of the armed forces and veterans who are present but not in uniform may render the military salute.
All other persons present should face the flag and stand at attention with their right hand over the heart, or if applicable, remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart.
When stowing or disposing of the flag, DO the following:

Fold in the traditional triangle for stowage, never wadded up.
The flag should be folded in its customary manner.
It is important that the fire be fairly large and of sufficient intensity to ensure complete burning of the flag.
Place the flag on the fire.
The individual(s) can come to attention, salute the flag, recite the Pledge of Allegiance and have a brief period of silent reflection.
After the flag is completely consumed, the fire should then be safely extinguished and the ashes buried.
Please make sure you are conforming to local/state fire codes or ordinances.
Quick list of Flag Etiquette Don‚Äôts:

Don‚Äôt dip the U.S. Flag for any person, flag, or vessel.
Don‚Äôt let the flag touch the ground.
Don‚Äôt fly flag upside down unless there is an emergency.
Don‚Äôt carry the flag flat, or carry things in it.
Don‚Äôt use the flag as clothing.
Don‚Äôt store the flag where it can get dirty.
Don‚Äôt use it as a cover.
Don‚Äôt fasten it or tie it back. Always allow it to fall free.
Don‚Äôt draw on, or otherwise mark the flag.
Don‚Äôt use the flag for decoration. Use bunting with the blue on top, then white, then red.
nice idea
how many actually believe, or bleed for it?"
I've killed hundreds
i'll probably have to do more
but most of you have no idea what it takes
can't IMT
can't bound and overtake an objective
thats 150 rounds per man right there and physical fitness
22 years, and not quiting, get off your ASSES
I'm about to hang mine upside down. To me, people more concerned about flag etiquette than the state of this nation and its government gone rogue, is DEFINITELY a state of emergency. Of course, you can proudly display the new U.S.S.A. flag appropriately....United Socialist States of America.....right?
we'll fly our flags tall and proud
these people will never understand
they dont care about truth
just as my ancestors stood at selkirk and culloden
and those of us that have worn the uniform, we will never dishonor our nations flags'
I won't ever dishonor any American flag ever
I think we should always remember
and honor, and yes, make changes
and I can say that as a son of the south and love the confederacy
we are past it
but we should not forget the great heritage of what makes us American
so much has been paid, I don't regret any of it, and I am grateful
I spent my youth in the middle east and central Asia
i dont regret one day
the only thing that hurts is losing brothers

I'm in i accepted and responded this morning.
Yes all is well.
If you can wait until Memorial day is over so the person can enjoy it with his/her family. I don't enter a Starbucks or any place that sides with the enemy. Thanks.
Remember, if you are new to please go to the globe at the top which is our Directory, find your state and introduce yourself!
Cool, good! I know Phantom personally.  Hes a good guy.  Jump in and help where you can!
hey moonshine quit being so shy! :laughing: ...come join the club!
I am the quiet, shy and demure type!
And right now snagging people from here is about the only way we are recruiting at the moment.  So if any Ga people pop up i want them to go to our #GA
we're all shy in our own ways... thats why we ain't locked up (yet):laughing: the invite to join the crew on signal stands if your ever interested!
Which crew? I think i missed it
do you have a proton mail acct?
the crew is a scattered bunch of members from all over the states - we threw this together in the event we lose the RC comms here - everyone exchanged contact info thru proton then moved into the secure signal chat grp
We appreciate that.  Thats a great idea about not meeting in a Starbucks.  I despise their policies.  Thanks for reminding me.  It needs to be somwhere you feel ok with, thats all.  I submitted your data for a background check.  This is standard for everyone.  Nothng extraordinary.  Something like what an employer would do.  It shouldent take to long.  After we recieve that back we'll set up the meeting.
Have a meaningful Memorial Day.  God Bless America and its deceased veterans !

"Despite our best attempts to engage, the clout chasers met us with hostility, vague threats, threats of doxxing, and general toxic machismo, selfish behavior.   Local conservative journalists received invitations to cover black bloc actions without the explicit consent of core organizers from this same person. Members of the press were very aggressive and stuck cameras in masked faces, refusing to adhere to multiple requests to respect our group and protesters in our community."

Have started giving the magnet test to my friends who have taken the jab. 100% so far have had a magnet stick to them. It is very disturbing for all involved...
Good morning all Oath Keepers!
Yeah it‚Äôs sad we have to think like that and more sad people are willingly taking that shot 
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=592kA3pLjuh3hRirx) If true, this would be earth shattering. Yet, it's buried. What else do we know about this? Does anyone have contacts in the intel comm that confirms?
I have little belief this is happening, but hope it is and that all of them can be rooted out once and for all‚Ä¶.it is very hard to believe based on some high ranking AF officers I am familiar with from when they were Cpts and Lt‚Äôs and a few commanders I had late in my career
I think it's interesting China hasn't jumped on Taiwan yet, nor Russia on Ukraine since Biden took the Oath of Office. I wonder why.  Why are China and Russia hesitating? What are they waiting for? Hmm. Perhaps China and Russia have intel corroborating Dr. Roth's claim. If we are on the verge of reinstating Trump as rightful president, and I were China or Russia, I'd wait to see how it all shakes out.
Am I the only one anxious to see Kamala succeed Biden? I mean, Biden is bad for mainstream Democrats, but Kamala would absolutely DESTROY the Democrat party for generations to come.
It has been talked about since before the election. Biden in for a short while and then they will replace him with Kamala
I think all a hoax. The Marxists are in charge now.
She would screw up the D‚Äôs but will she destroy our country too? 
Interesting thought KAZ. I am hopeful something is being done behind the scenes but at best I am 30-70 for believing it, at best‚Ä¶..
Are they talking the same thing as the earlier article about Pres Trump and the military? Who knows and who knows what is going on behind the scenes‚Ä¶.

Negative. A full forensic audit of Maricopa county is about 1/2 finished. A trial forensic audit in Windham, NH has concluded and the report is being readied now. A partial forensic audit of Fulton County, GA is on hold for a few weeks. There is a push for additional forensic audits in several more states. Certain data is being withheld until some audits conclude to verify the data already revealed in Mike Lindell's two videos Absolute Proof and Absolute Interference. There is more, but you get the picture...
I agree. The claim that a HUGE sting op is in play to out the Deep State is fantastical. Far fetched is an understatement. Or, in another respect, too good to be true. As much as I would LIKE to believe all this is true, honestly it smacks of wishful thinking.  Or WORSE, patriots end up patiently clinging to claim after empty claim like these, affording the Left time to consolidate power.
@DaveyE7  Yes, she will try to destroy our country.
Denbo, Yes, we OKers are ALL targets. I knew before sending my first OKer membership payment online that doing so would put a target on my back. I accept it because I stand for something.  Everyday since Jan 6th, I've expected a knock on my door from the ABC boys. I accept it because I stand for something.
_"Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God!"_  Patrick Henry, 1775.
me too KAZ! i ran straight into the 'burning building' i wasn't about to stand by & do nothing! im also NOT suicidal so i keep the motor idling instead of raising hell everywhere! i just wish some in our private signal chat could see the importance of OPSEC & that throwing threats around the web or discussing the desire to 'start the action' WILL bring the door knock even quicker! im too old to be locked up because 'someone' else's loose lips!
Like you, my brother, I hold OPSEC a very high priority. As well we all should, particularly in times like these.  For my own peace of mind, I consider what do I have control over, and what do I not have control over. Ultimately, the only thing I have control over are my own decisions, actions, and my relationship with God. Which of course makes me feel pretty damn powerless.  On the other hand, I walk with the good Lord, infinite, ALL POWERFUL God. I'm in good company.
Besides, Denbo, first they gotta go through me to get to you. And I'm not an easy target.
KAZ YOUR A GREAT BRO!! ITS AN HONOR TO BE A PART OF THIS ORGANIZATION WITH YOU SIR!!
And I with you.
Memorial Day weekend can be a very painful time for many Americans. For many, it is not a 3-day weekend of BBQs and swimming pools.  I try to keep that in mind as we all try get through this special weekend.

This article posted yesterday is worth a read. With so much insidious secrecy poisoning our government, I like to keep abreast of any and all intel, news, theories, and rumors. This is one such article.  @denbo  thanks for posting it.

On one hand the article is far fetched. On the other hand the article is welcome news---a historic, sweeping sting op to drain the swamp. Is it too good to be true? 

Whether the article strikes you as fanciful or credible, there lies within a certain hazard in wishful thinking. The danger is this: Patriots patiently clinging to hopeful rumor after hopeful rumor, awaiting the promise the cavalry is on the way, affords the Left time to consolidate power. Let's not forget, WE ARE THE CAVALRY.

Whatever direction things turn.
Should this somehow come to be it will put the final nail in any chance of a peaceful resolution , the lefties will go batshit crazy. I'm indifferent to that.
I just wonder if this is another front in this war being waged quietly
May we never forget those who came before us.   :flag_us:
It is another front and it isn't exactly being waged quietly, it's just being minimally reported on. Maricopa county has been fighting this tooth and nail since Nov/Dec to even proceed but have lost in the courts even after bringing in hi profile legal teams. They claim the voting system was isolated from the Internet but are currently fighting turning over routers that could prove this. Why wouldn't they want to prove this? The sheriff has come out in the county's defense saying it would compromise their MCSO system if the voting system routers are turned over. But wait, they said they weren't connected to anything. Things that make you go hmmmmm?

Not sure how that will work since there killing each other in droves everyday. 
what is disturbing is the double standard in play - can you imagine if oathkeepers had a rally somewhere & spewed out this kind of crap? every single person in attendance would be locked up in no time! these clowns get a free pass & the media pushes the threat to a nationwide audience - maximum impact & free advertising

Moonshine the feds are using Oathkeeper chat rooms to gather evidence, then acting on it. its in the articles regarding 'more OK arrests' - i confirmed this with my IC sources - there are active bills in congress to make membership in this organization enough to be arrested

SR said that statement in an interview with Alex Jones or someone else recently that I watched. He also said, the part they miss, that he wanted to make sure no one got caught up in the melee accidentally‚Ä¶that‚Äôs already in record
every word SR stated was in the Oathkeeper bulletins emailed to the membership - we all know his 'every word' - however you are witnessing the evidence building process - feds are using this organization to set the example - their plan (if successful) is to take down every member & shutter the org. - the more they post this false propaganda in repeated fashion, the more 'legit' they think they are in regard to ending 'us' - it won't happen & we WON'T need to SHOOT! keep the Faith bro, we just got to get thru 'summer':wink:
I am not concerned by anything any of the LSM say especially MSN
nor am i brother! but this IS a war & we just need to hold the line thru summer! they'll throw everything at us even the kitchen sink to get us to act - the 'baiting' will get worse - we stand fast & they will destroy themselves

[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=WdovDWTaAmO12xTJH) :boom: Dave, I read your departing post in Corral :confounded: Behind the scenes I have had lengthy phone conversations with Denbo, and DMs with Gary.  Frustrating, and I can't say that I blame you for getting the hell outta Dodge.  I had hoped to instill  some discipline by eliminating chaos through organization and procedures.  Nope!  It appears to have exacerbated things. Spent many hours believing that we all could develop something beneficial to our Patriot cause. I will also be making a decision today.  The area may be Hog-free as of tomorrow morning.  Salute!

Hog :cowboy:
Hog, I was hoping that too but wasn‚Äôt to be. Denbo was right to be concerned about OPSEC. But so was Gary and denbo should not have said Gary don‚Äôt talk to him and start that whole mess, hence my commentary this morning. 8 years of membership alone the entire time here in NC and I was hoping to start something and thought we did with our group. I will not leave OK as I believe in this organization. I will continue to communicate with Gary but denbo is starting to be suspect to me. I don‚Äôt know anything specific just a gut feel is all‚Ä¶.and nothing but respect for you sir as always‚Ä¶.
Good morning Patriots!

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
And while we are on the Signal chats why was I taken out of Corral 2?
When Denbo had established a Kill Switch for Corral, I grabbed the name Corral 2 and gave everyone access.  When he settled down and did not kill Corral, I gave Corral 2 a few days and deleted all of us.  When establishing Corral 2, I stated that it was a hold.  I posted that in Corral 2 so Denbo would not see it.  I posted the following this morning in Corral:

üòû  Well, slowly the exits continue, and surpassed by the entries - depopulation!

The hope was that we all could instill some discipline by eliminating chaos (stress) through structure, organization and agreed-to procedures.  Nope!  It seems to have had the opposite effect; that being, exacerbated the situation.

Our membership numbers are now sufficient for a treehouse fort that many of us might remember.

Personally, I am suspending all involvement and work until a personal decision is made later today, after sufficient meditation. 

Truthfully, this reminds me of my time in the military (1967-1972 and SEA 1968-1969).  It was still the time of the Draft and cohesion, phony as it was, appeared only during times supported by a sufficient amount of alcohol and silly weed.

It was my sincere hope that we might accomplish something here that would have been a paradigm for other Patriots.

The zone might be Hog-free come morning.

I truly hate failure...üòñ

Hog ü§†
Be advised we are resetting the AL chat today.  You will see your messages disapear.  This is normal.  It happens periodically.
There has been GOOD VHF propagation in the north east the last few days.  I have been hearing both WX and USCG on VHF at much greater distances than normal.  From NYC hearing USCG Delaware Bay 5x5 for hours at a time.
I hear ya sir. Denbo just ranted off in the Saloon and I will be blunt, I feel like something is off. Not sure about him anymore. Gary did not try and sow discord just voice his opinion, denbo keeps insulting not only Gary but FUBAR as well. So that does not work for unit cohesion in my book either. We all agreed on Chris, we all agreed on OPSEC, so why the getting personal crap posts? And again I was hoping for something better as well‚Ä¶.been waiting a while
Kait entered the Corral and responded.  One of my last posts stated that I don't need all the Signal drama.

OK - Kait - Kaithylton‚Å©
None of us need thus drama.  I appreciate all the time & effort by Hog & Denbo to create semi safe place for us to be in contact and chat.  It completely defeats the purpose if it becomes a circular firing squad.  There is already too much heat on our backs by merely being members
Agreed and we don‚Äôt need that crap
Good to hear from you jpj 
Nothing about Ashly Babbit EVER on msm.
Nope never

Any of our HF members adebt in or have the software to to run analysis on this thought I have regarding capacitance hats?
In much the same way that a fan dipole works, where the different frequencies seek the lengths of the antenna that best match them. 
My idea is to build a multi band capacitance hat from multiple sized rings of incrementally increasing diameters, ie. 4', 6', 8', 10' & 12' diameter.
I look forward to your feedback.
Thanks,
Gary
Thank you.  Yes, we hear rumor's but its obvious he has went silent.
agreed, very sad! we must not forget her!!
K replied to your email
It has been stated recently that The Oath Keepers "is not" a milicia. And though that may be "technically" true at this very point in time. There is a very thin line between what we are today and what we may very well be tomorrow. 
For our members to deny the fact that this could change in an instant, is not facing the reality or the seriousness of the current state of our Republic! 
As our founder Stewart Rhodes and Attorney Kelley SoRelle have so eloquently stated in their letter to the one and only President Donald J. Trump (which I might add, mentions "militia" 14 times) "to call up the militia (including the National Guard, US veterans, and patriotic Americans of military age) and US military to suppress the insurrection."
"And the militia includes not only the National Guard units of each state, called into federal service, but also includes the body of the people, age 17-45, and especially US military veterans, who are by federal statute subject to call up for service as the militia until age 65, due to our prior training and experience."

Good morning all Oath Keepers!
Good American Morning fellow Patriots! 
I've seen that, must have overlooked that it is multi banded.
Good American Morning Fellow Patriots !
Ok first props to the Officer! Way to hang in sister! Second what an asshat! Was he defending his cat? Why shoot? Idiot!!!
Good morning Patriots!

This asshat needs to fired, charged and jailed or hung. He is the dangerous  fed employee out of control and not checked at all
All just heard wildman1959 had a successful, uneventful protest at the MI state capital. Additionally he has a family member going into the USMC and they are having a party. Wanted to pass on my üëçüèªüëçüèª for an inspiring job well done and best of luck from 1 old vet to a new future vet. All should pass on congrats‚Ä¶.üá∫üá∏
Hoo-Ah Chris the wilman1959!
Congrats on extending the tradition in your family and for being ever vigilant in standing up to tyranny!
No shite! But we live under a two tier legal system! 
Yes we do unfortunately 
Hey --- This is John / state leader for FL.    I heard you did a protest at MI state capital.   Interested in any details you're willing to share, as we are about to have a "protest" outside a military base here.    Just looking for insight / thoughts on how it went.
its made to work with this, so I'd say yeah.

It is called THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT. I was at the capitol steps at 10 am on Memorial Day, and spoke in no uncertain terms for 50 minutes straight via bullhorn about stopping the steal, the unconstitutional mail in ballots used that cannot be legitimately verified, so with our judiciary stating there wasn't enough proof that the results would have differed, which wasn't what was asked of them, just if these ballots were unverifiable, it now stands that all candidates who received votes via straight ticket mail-in ballots, all state and federal representatives including executive and judiciary cannot be considered fairly election, and a new election and process must take place. Since this constitutes our representatives literally selecting themselves, we must never accept the results. There were not many people, the downside, me being capable of making a case right nicely the upside. A weekday at the capitol at lunchtime next, and the front sidewalk of Channel 4 news in Detroit after that. I'll continue to work this indefinitely. Send a number and I'll text some photos.... Chris Wilding 734-478-9756.
Gentlemen, thanks for the kind words. I told Ava, my granddaughter the most important USMC aspect is being ALWAYS FAITHFUL. And the Marines have a pretty good track record to boot....
They do and a pretty good track record for being Always Faithful!
You must be a very proud Poppa Chris!
And I know that you are Ever Faithful! 
Wow! Davey wholly crap ha! 
The Big-Tech Giants on one hand and now our own American Legion, freedom of speech be damnd! Society sure has gone to hell in a hurry here lately! 
I know and the LtCol knew they did it. Unbelievable!
Hopefully this will lead to more dropped charges for some of the others! ü§ûüèª
That's a great setup! 
I think you once told me that's the antenna you use? 
Good morning all Oath Keepers! Not many up at this early hour‚Ä¶..stay safe and vigilant!

Fanatic, I breezed thru Waco in poor shape and didn't bother contacting you as I didn't want you to get whatever I had... Some kind of chest cold and ulcers... Back in Florida for a few weeks, then Indiana and back to the DFW before returning to Presidio... POSSIBLY could make a run for Waco around the end of June?

"Rally" went down -- just me.    I planted some signs outside the main entrance to Mayport Naval Station.    Hopefully some of the rank and file read it - and understood.
Just heard Alan West is resigning from his position in Texas GOP and considering a run for Governor of Texas!!
One I will be that way too Hog!
Yup, I have the MPAS v1, but its pretty much the same thing
To ALL: ALWAYS do your research and RECON and COLLABORATION with family, friends and collegues BEFORE you act on ANYTHING! READ, BE VERY AWARE: https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2020_10_06_homeland-threat-assessment.pdf also https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/18_0116_MGMT_DHS-Lexicon.pdf and THIS ONE came out in 2009, the start-up year of Oathkeepers! https://fas.org/irp/eprint/lexicon.pdf
I have a question for the experts. This is probably nothing but a guy at the gym who I have talked to before and is a county sheriff took my phone he says by accident and left. A gal there happened to see him do it and when I was looking for my phone told me. I had the gym call him but he was pulling back into the parking lot as she called. He showed me that he has the same phone and said it was a mistake. With all that is going on with the Jan 6th stuff, do I have anything to worry about? He had it for maybe 5-10 minutes. Not sure what he could have done to it if he had ill intent.
I would say if your on signal and the Officer actually got into your phone;  your contacts could be compromised?  I was told that is the only way to infiltrate encrypted communication such as signal or proton.  However, there is probably other ways.  As long as your not doing anything illegal;  I wouldn't sweat it.   Good Luck
He didnt get in unless he had the same thumbprint as me. Thanks!
The commies are trying to change what legal and what is not so not doing anything illegal under current laws.
Evening patriots
andyjack, check your phone log to ensure he did not make a call.  If he did, verify the number.  That is when he possibly realized that he had the wrong phone since the Contacts would certainly be different.  The phone log would tell you if he manually dialed.  If yours is accessed by thumbprint I wouldn't worry.
I'm with you. The Pentagon full of brass are supposed to protect the citizens from this domestic terrorist.....our own government..... Follow the Constitution over the chain of command....they are WAY out of step with We the People.....
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=XRBcaQbQ4gL77CCWQ) I hear ya
The prosecution's comment (referring to Lt. Cmdr. Caldwell)  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs safe for the community for him to be allowed to go wherever he wants whenever he wants.‚Äù is such BS! And a prime example of the double standards in our Justice System! These men are not violent criminals, no, they are Patriot protestors who were exercising their 1st Amendment rights! :flag_us:
[ ](https://chat.oathkeepers.org/channel/general?msg=b44EYo4f7wh5neY7u) One lone judge who will be overturned on appeal to the 9th Circuit, and SCotUS won't take up the case because "compelling public safety interest" or somesuch.
On another note - just in case you're still unsure of the current state of Civil War 2.0 in America
"A dumpster was set on fire‚Äîmelting to the ground, and a few windows were smashed. The event was mostly peaceful‚Äîproperty destruction is not violent. Most people chatted with each other and stared into the fire with righteous joy. At the same time, comrades held down GFS and continued to re-enforce barricades. It is inspiring how quickly and how militantly that space was reclaimed."
Are you also using the Cap Hat?
I would take your phone to an expert shop ASAP and have it checked out! Or if you are due an upgrade or have insurance on it use one of those two options to replace it!
And be careful what you use it for in the meantime! 

Good American Morning to you my brothers and sisters in the fight for freedom! 
Good Morning Massachusetts! 
Absolutely! Double standards will be paid for one day‚Ä¶
Good morning all Oath Keepers!
Bunch of fools. And yes no doubt the war is creeping more and more into every day life. Our country is a powder keg

This magistrate needs not grant them another 60 day extension. This is ridiculous as well as the comment we may never show the defense all of the video footage i.e. your evidence! They have no case and they are waiting for us to give them more to hang on our OK brothers and sisters in jail now. Idiots!
Your background check came back in good order.  Again we thank you for your patience.  We'll be reaching out for a phone call but expect an in person meeting next week if possible.
Whats up patriot?
Good morning from Georgia!
Where is out GOP?
About to head into madison to pick up two trailer tires that i had mounted.
SD Governor Kristi Noem just finished speaking at the NC State GOP Convention, one of the most genuine, smart and uplifting speeches in a long long time! She is one of our two best Governors, the other being FL Governor Ron DeSantis!
With inspiration and hope from strong leaders like this we will prevail! 
Duty Honor Country, 
And God Bless These United States! 

Yes captbob they are trying to paint that picture and will apply their duplicitous Justice against our people. But they can not fabricate the existence of weapons that were not there! The Patriots that were there were not armed and that takes the wind out of their proverbial sails!
Yes I have given thought of writing my Senators since my Rep is a dimwit so that won‚Äôt do any good! But yes where the heck are they!!!????
She is a Rock Star!
yeah she is great
We have some real leaders out there really putting the screws to these awful scum bags
Which all of them should be doing buuuuuutttttt of course they aren‚Äôt
Some are, but, yes your right. Talk and stating the obvious is all the politicians are gonan do.
Eventually there will be an overt act of force by the left. It won't be this gradual slide into sickness forever.
The old lady has me making big rocks into small, or more accurately, moving large and replacing with pea gravel.
Too broke down for this shite!
lol sounds like you got sent to the Brig brother
CCU, I have some bros that have Brig time, teach you all about defilement
No thanks, I'm good without that, thank you very much! üò≥
haha, right!
Theres alot of scum that do belong in a nice orange jumper
but the course of action I'd suggest on that, is something I can't say here or many other places
I'd lock them in super max with the Taliban
let them find out
Definitely something in that venue is called for!
why its there, happy to pay taxes for that
concrete bed, two sheets and a blanky
23 in the hole, one hour excersize out
what channel are you in? i see you typing all the time
mm, 
That's part of the problem with this Country, we play too nice, too fair!
Muslim jihadi extremists could so easily be taught to fear us! If we as a Nation had the balls to desecrate their remains, bury them with pig guts and face them 180¬∞ away from Mecca, they would know that if they messed with us they would not go to their version of heaven! 
Same type of thing with kid touchers, vote violators, corrupt politicians, etc. etc...
Yeah your telling me brother, I've gone 22 years pulling triggers on this
Read the bear went over the mountain
Soviets in Afghan
Make crimes of the latter fall under treason and enforce to the fullest extent of the law!
Yeah, Agreed brother
You know about Rosemont?
the Bidens company?
I did not, but I just gave it a quick check online. Corruption galore! 
go dig into that, it will make you puke
thats where Hunter and all their asshats get their cash
china pays them and they aquire us assets
with chinas cash
thats why they put that pedo in office
watch ''the plot against the president''
most of it is there

Good morning all! Let us not forget those brave brothers and sisters that sacrificed and gave their all on D Day at H Hour Normandy! In this time we find ourselves, we must live up to that courage and determination!
FYI:  Dave, Kait, Kelley and I have reopened OK Sheriff.  Kait is the Chief Admin and Kelley her backup.  Kait and I agreed that we need a secure(?) OK Emergency Communications venue.  It will be open to all OKers with no vetting, so she will announce and handle adding access for everyone.  No one has access yet, I just wanted to give you a heads-up and get your opinion.
Yes I agree we need an emergency comms area for just that, no chit chat, to keep the channel clear. They can make announcements as they see fit as if they would put them in Now Hear This on here. 
Thanks Hog!
I was there that day 11 September 2004 when Brian was hit. Over 150 people stood in line to give him O negative blood, including me, as the call went out for that blood type for him. That was a bad day all around. What they are doing to him is nothing more than following the CCP party line of smearing veterans. They do this because whether we are organized or not, members of OK, III% or anything else we are a threat. All vets have a target on our backs in my opinion, so we all have to have each other‚Äôs 6 at all times
They cannot leave anything alone that has God in it or pronouns or whatever wild hair grows up their land of proctology, as Hog is so fond of saying
"Redfox" seems offline/redacted

_Kevin Annett rejoins the program to discuss the mass child grave site uncovered in Canada. He discusses the fact that at least 28 more mass child grave sites exist and still need to be uncovered. Also, to make matters worse, there are an additional 6 sites still being used to dump bodies of trafficked children and Native Americans. These sites have been known by authorities for years._

bravo-echo,
That's a heavy bit of sad truth and all the more proof of the double standards in our Justice System! The FBI has become the modern day Gestapo for the current day Third¬†Reich aka the "Demonrat Party"!
Agreed ssgtgman! Of course have we come to expect anything less than this kind of bs from the FBI? Sadly no, they have stopped being an effective law enforcement agency and are now a string arm weapon of the commie lefties
Good morning all Oath Keepers! Stay safe and vigilant!
Good morning!
There are 35,000 members of Oath Keepers. Maybe. There are 18 million veterans in this country. Definitely. Notice a huge disparity with those numbers....? Same Oath, same Constitution. My wondering about the state of patriotism in this country begins and ends right there with those numbers. Without responsibility, integrity does not exist. How could it....?
how are you moonshine?
Pretty good.  Rainy day here
right on
your in the South, right?
a Veteran too?
Yes and yes.
From Ohio to WV to the Army than out at Benning than all over and up and down the east coast and south.
I was 11bang my whole career between the corps and army
nothing against POGS bro
of course 0300 field in the corps, but we bounce around
0311, 41,52
it is what it is
right on
your the only other one ive met
anti-tank.  Carried the Dragon than went to Redstone and helped test the Javelin while it was being developed.  I was one of 7 who picked the name.  So thats nice lol   Im famous!
there is definitely a 11B drought here
Alot of tech guys
yeah, my last combat tour, we blew the hell out of Taliban with ITAS systems, Javs. worked out well
and alot of AT4s and LAWs
They pack a punch
Now China has copied the Jav
threw a ton of 2As and BS
were you a 11H guy?
back in the day??
anti armor?
that used to be the id
No, they did that change like in 2002 or something
its just 11B now
they switch 11D t o19D many years ago
I broke my back in 92 so that ended my career.
yeah mine is pretty smashed now too, but I'm still going
ankles, knees
all that
to many years in the airbourne and combat
Ya me too. had a fusion in 95.  Kept driving on.  in Feb i had PRP/Stem cell treatment in my disks and facets.  That has been a god send. Its worked very very well.  But insurance doesnt cover it and i refuse to use the VA so i saved the cash and had it done
yeah my aunt and uncle did that
they said the same
They wanted to do more fusions.  no way.
they paid out of pocket, they could afford it
They can do that on knees too.    I did have to save money.  8500 dollars for 4 disks, the facets up to my rib cage and a PRP epidural up my tail bone.
i'm just fueled by hate,anger, and patroitism at this point
blood, sex, and danger.
That was eating me up, so i try to put the hate and anger aside take a step back and try to see a broader picture.   Many of those jack holes arent worth my hate.
You on national Signal chat?
DM'ed you
Yeah I hear ya
no< but I am on signal, I know SR
I talk to him personally every once In awhile

by, lets say probably allies
to show me , were here
they didn't have to contact or tell me
I dont know.  We get bits, pieces of info.  Scraps if that
but I got sent text and dms, and they showed me they were watching OK
like a reminder, dont mess up
from friendly scources
Well i expected we we were being watched.   Good of them to let you know
didnt ever expect it
We had 2 guys go to DC. Neither went into the building.  Both visited by FBI.
they photographed me and others, and I was always hiding my face, they sent me pics of that
Both are Vets and said how DC was ran was a cluster and they didnt really want to be part of an Org ran like that.
Oh damn.
DC was a pmc op
it was all excutive outcomes, mostly SA, south african, Ive worked with them before In the middle east and Asia
did ops with them on the farm
they are really good
sas, sbs guys
So what was the confusion with OK in DC?
from the brits and aussies
BTW, im one of the POC's for Georgia.
E.O was Blackwater?
it goes back to the holding company that owns BW
which is constellis, if im spelling it correctly
I get it
its academy
but you know what I'm sayingg
What were they supposed to be doing in DC?
everyone owns a piece
they were paid for years ago, long term
thats why we had them overseas doing all the wet work
our guys came back and said comms sucked, command and control sucked, nobody knew what they hell was going on and after the Stone mission they were pretty much left wandering around
its all former sas and sbs guys mostly
they had your on LLVI
they knew what you were gonna do before you even did it brother
you guys are out of league on tech
No doubt
they had you on language intercept
Who was E.O working with and why?
Just what was OK there for?
most of that was teams working internal that were paid for
you guys were clean
Very much
they could hear everything you were doing
should have gone sat phones
That much we could guess
mousad watches signal
yes!!!   Cell phones? When we ran the Atlanta op we all got burners, which was the best we could do with no money.
and can break it
burners wont work
All we had.
sat phones only
I told all the guys here
bao fangs, china and intercept
Ive tried to tell all these folks for months
We have bao's.   When we formed this group last Aug we got NO direction, no suggestions, had no money
icoms radios and use code
works for the taliban
In atlanta national rolled in with no plans, no comms plan...nothing.
go cheap and build a code network that shifts weekly
Yes.  We discussed how Taliban does things too.  They had to figure it out
We were on that road than 1-6 happened and we lost 70% of our people.
got to go old school
very old school
yes so a machine doesnt comprehend
switch by word paly
Yes.   One that looks for how we speak, words, phrases
Ya go back to pig Latin like when we were young
In your opinion....just what was the purpose of OK in DC?
everything else is locked down
they were waiting for some to fuck up brother
to go all in
SR kept talking about insurrection acts, SF going into FBI and CIA and securing the buildings.....which seemed to me to be a bit out there
he is right, but the reality is they had you pegged up top
OK command and control seemed lacking and SR was in a hotel room with Kellye when the capitol doors were breached?
someone with him knows, is working for them
a mole?
I told SR this
Of course.......
SR makes himself SO visible and is so vocal
this is why I don't come in here much anymore
we have to, OK doesnt hide
Ya i jump in, say hello.  Thats about all
we are transparent
someone was involved, or im leaning toward intercept
Antifa doesnt do this....they are distributed cells and their leaders are way more dark.  not like OK and PB
antifa is very capable
they have been around for 50+ years
and they have gov assets and support
When i stood at my window and watched OWS march in DC i told my wife from that something more will be built. Something much more organized.
For sure, why else would they be allowed to do as they do?  And as you well know, everything happens for a REASON.
OK is great, but its operating around SR and afew at the top
ya'll have a problem brother
its not in the rooms, its with someone you know and think you can trust
cut it down like this
who was in DC
When i met him he seemed to be insulated around an entourage.  But mind you, we have only been with OK less than a year. Trying to figure t hings out and stay alert
who was in DC
SR. Whip
cut it from them
pick apart who serves them
and who they are with
youll find it
We just dont know enough of the bosses to say
that list isnt long
I could do it
everyone has to cough up cells , personal records, Id.me
all of it
I dont want to step in a pile of shit out of ignorance!
well, I can tell you right now
Than its between you and i
I'm pretty fuckin far from ignorant on this shit
Ya i get the feeling when i joined OK there is much more going on than i realized.  Sh-t isnt adding up.
anyone that refuses the full anal cav search goes top of the list
that DC list is short
someone with damn near full access
Besides the 2 new members who just had to go we were not involved in DC at all, so not sure who all went.
has to be pretty high bro
No doubt.
They only people at national we know are SR and Whip.
And that is from meeting them in Atlanta
I told SR he was fucking up in tactful terms
I told him he needs a SGM/CSM
Apparently more than a few told him that
and a true command structure
YES! i said the same thing
we need a full Infantry BN structure
we need an XO
and staff
But...apparently after his people at national left him a few years ago and it seems spoke to the press he just had a few close people around him and tried to run everything
I did not see that in Atlanta.  A few entourage around him and to be honest they were more than aloof with us.
full vetted national staff
then we made a PSD
of trigger pullers like me and you
and we branch down from there
and vette every fuckin soul
yes.  organized with a clear mission
:fire: Was This A Deep State Dry Run? :fire: 

https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/reddit-down-users-unable-access-website

Hog :cowboy:
hey man, I worked with the teams in JSOC
I know how to do this
Vetting.....when we used to get new members from national we didnt trust their vetting. so we pay for a background service, run a check and personally review their social media.  Than compile a report, review it than vote that person into Ga. Only then do they get into Signal
honestly besides you, SR is the only other trigger puller I know in OK
and not to knock either of you
I'm recently retired
Easy life now......
and Ive been in hundreds of fire fights
and I know these disgusting people
i was just a bit disappointed in organizational standards at National
yeah its shit
a spc4 could have run this better
So we here in Ga saw that and developed clear SOP, chain of command, what Comms we could, a TOC........in less than a year
yeah, well, yeah your right
We got really good compliments from members in DC who had been on other ops.  We had a triage van too with a nurse.
yeah I can cover alot of triage and all that myself
you can too with your training
the problem I have with OK has been and always will be talk,talk ,talk
never want to train or get better at anything
part of the reason I want to go back to the south
One Q many of our people  here asked was if this was the most important vote in the history of the republic-as SR said-he had people on the ground on ops why was he in a hotel with Kellye off site? Leadership is first in, last out
Better hurry, land is expensive and getting worse!
well, if we have to work in cells
I would have been In DC at least two weeks before
I was stationed there
I could have come in and setup way before
Ya i was over at the Treasury so im familiar with the area. Lived in Woodbridge, va
I would have had advon
I was in DC and Quantico
been to Q!
Lived in Laurel,Baltiore
I have people that are tact team,detectives, swat there
we could have know all of their movements
and all we had to is record and not get involved
So i guess what i am confused about and what would make things more clear is.   1.  What was the OK mission? 2. What went wrong.   3. Why?
thats my point
no drills on paper or otherwise
we could have drilled this out, done a leaders recon
put some METC on the terrain
done some terrain models
we could have even prevented violence
and been a barrier between radicals and LE
we'd be HUGE heros now
That makes too much sense compared to what we witnessed
Was the OK mission to escort big names like Stone around? Be seen?
imagine OK all of us in your old uniforms getting in the way and turning the crowds of fuck sticks around
I think Stone,Jones,etc they are all good guys
but thats who SR trusts
Right, instead our Ga guys were wandering around with no supervision and no idea what to do?

professionalism is what OK lacks
Yet Kellye last night said this....Stone and the rest used us?
brother, these are people that dont have our professionalism and training
Election fight is a IIA op like Q?  (I thought Q was BS anyway and obviously a Phy op)
they have zero idea
There seems to be alot of confusion swirling around SR.
nah they are just ignorant brother
yeah cause he hasnt put together a cohesive force or plan as far as I've seen
none of us wants violence, ever
Less time on Jones show engaging in groupthink would have helped...imo
otherwise this shit is a mob
yes. absolutely right and how we feel as well
well, I got your back, train your troops bro
you know how, your not a pussy
What we have left we are trying.....just seems we are doing it in a vacuum.
I know
trust it is a vacuum at this point, thats why I said fuck off to these people
in your opinion what is to happen with SR and the future of OK?
I think its gonna die within a year
precisely because of what you and I have addressed
right here
Our Regional command popped up, told us to for 501;s for our state.   Now we arnt dumb.  SR goes to ground, phone picked up, confusion than form 501's while leadership goes quiet on chat? Something smells
they pissed away their chanced to show themselves, other americans,and the world
and it came down to letting rambo idiots who eat bowls of dumbass for breakfast sprinkled with retard run the show
The reason i picked OK over other groups is i didnt want to be part of some BS outfit that pops off rounds in the woods than bitches about Dems over a beer.  I wanted to be part of a groupf of former military who has their heads on straight, knows how to organize and wants to be a group that can make a difference.  I dont mean going to war and have fantasies of being  gung-ho
Michael Flynn is the only guy up there with the know who can credentials to run anything
and we have tons of other Flag officers that can do it
i know plenty
Will any join to lead under an OK banner at this point?
we need a real washington type to set forward, make a site and say no
I dont know
Has the name OK been successfully poisoned?
the masses are to brain washed brother
maybe, thats what they wanted, and we walked right into it
its the columns of insurgency
Damn sure did
first, they got OK and militias
second, LE with George Floyd and the like
3rd, in the process of killing the armed forces
4rd, they have all of media and social media
5th, universities, reprogram all of the young
not in that order, but you see my point
we've been fucked with a cock so big an elephant can feel it
Yes....its very much planned and obvious.  Any student of history and has read Communist history knows what must happen
Yes, you and i very much think alike and noticed the same thing.  The left plays the long game too
i'm gonna call it incompetence at this point brother
maybe stupidity
Our military was the last bastion of traditional America and had to be brought down
yeah and they got it
by the short and curlies
i call it willful ignorance because those who should have stood against it did nothing and watched it happen
at this point, In my military mind
here is wha twe have left
wanna hear it?
i'll break down what we have to do
this will take awhile, but this is a plan you can start, gonna run to the store, you can call me
shop is just around the corner
in 2001 in DC there was a company brought in to do a survey.  They found racism and sexism.  We were forced to take classes on institutional racism. They told us everything we are hearing today and made us literally take a test parroting it.  Than we had to attend a speech ON property by a man who was obviously communist, said we needed to do away with elections by the people, ect ect.  Standing ovation.   Our Fed has been far left for a very very long time.  After this the mass emails from minority employees were so violent and anti-white the Director of the US Mint sent out a notice to knock it off.
Let me get with the family, eat and all that. i have running around to do as well.    We can meet up back here
So far its alot to digest
okay, Ill be back in 20
k see you in 30
If this is true, it is sad news indeed and hopefully will not spread! The pressure being applied by this Gestapo variant of the FBI is not a light hand but we must resist! 
https://www.vice.com/en/article/3anmkv/this-three-percenter-group-just-cancelled-itself-because-of-the-capitol-riots
appreciate it.   To call i would from Signal.  I have to go to the end of my driveway to get a cell signal and its off and on rain today.  Otherwise i would need to call from my landine
im back
Hope not but its not looking great
i got my tea.
take your time
oh im fine.
your what late 40s? 50s?
My wife met SR and knows some of what has been going on. She said months ago SR was stupid and leading us into a hole lol
just turned 50
nah he isnt
I think he has shitbirds around him
spent to little time in uniform due to his injuries
and to much time as a lawyer, but hes defintely good people
but thats conjecture on my part
His world seems to be coming down around him
id still venture to say hes very intelligent and can run an org like this without the right people
Back to what you said about needing NCO's
plus the cross hairs have always been on him
he needs a true command structure
3% just disbanded.  that was just posted
this isnt a SF team
we have the make up, its gonna take 11Bs and 18s to build that
comes back t omy plan
to my plan*
no its not. most of our people in Ga are 50 and over.  Bad hips, knees, diabetes.   For them working in the community with homeless, vets, disaster relief was just as important as any security mission
diabetes can be defeated
quit being fat
get off your lazy ass
if you can walk to the fuckin frig, you can walk
get a kettle bell
Most of our people are not Iron Mike.
I had to learn how to walk again and lost most of the bones in my right leg, had my shoulders replaced, a knee
an ankle
fuck that shit
I'm 42 years old, been at this 22 years
im not one to sit around as well.
I still carry a 50 lb ruck and hump my ass off
I can be done, takes time to heal and rebuild
it can be done
just cant be a quiter
Past 2 years saw me doing that...rebuilding and healing.
can't smoke a quiter, I'll fall the fuck out
even broke i'd never fall out of a run
i'd never shame my PL or PSG, the Plt
fuck that
Seems i been throwing more money at my issues the older i get lol.  4 years ago had my ACL replaced than 8 months later humped the whole Teton Crest trail
Yeah man, I've been there, most of mine were wounds in Afghan
I just refused to quit
Than arthritis ate up my spine and disks collapsed.  Hence, the Stem cell/PRP which i recommend highly.
I'm nearly 300 percent on the books with the VA now
I have no good war stories.
I've got loads brother
served with 7 MOH receipents
they are making movies about us now
F-ck the VA. i hate them.  i am 100% unemployable but still worked, retired.   I hate the VA.
wanna see one of my firefights, watch ''the outpost''
Change your name here to Hollywood?  :grin:
haha nah, wrong place at the right time
Think ive seen that!
one of my old PL's is a MOH recipient too
I was there
a real walk in the park
Read Roe's book
ill look it up
red platoon
all real, they did a great job on the movie
:poop: Ain't never heard of this author Tess Owen, but reading his present and past :poop: , this character is a 4-letter word (Tess or Owen) coming or going.

It is going to be a long and hot Summer until the return of Real President Trump in August :pray: 

Hog :cowboy:
i lost 1/3 of my platoon in the first 3 months of that tour
that was my second in afghan
thats it
as a fellow grunt, you'll love it
you'll probably grab your AR and ruck and want to go for a run after
Hell yes
if you know who Dakota Meyer is, he was just down the road afew klicks
used to work with his team
And Hog, happy birthday to your pup!
How to explain it......ok if someone who was not military were to read it they would not understand what one HAS to do in situations such as that.
my PL for a time was Florent Groberg
you can look him up
got the MOH in 2012
Will, name is isnt familiar
I had him as a butter bar and taught him how to kickass, unfortunately he turned on us and ran for Hillary
we havent spoken sense
If anything it looks like this leak may have lead to them having to at least make the appearance of a drawdown! 

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/us-militia-membership-military-police-american-patriot-three-percenter-website-leak
I told him I was completely ashamed of him and he disgraced us
Lord help him
to be a Ranger and betray us that way
Fuck him
cut me so deep
especially as a Ranger
fucking killed me
I signed up and had a guaranteed slot in Ranger school.  Got asked to do the Javelin thing than broke my back.  X ray showed i was born with Spina Bifida. Shocked the hell out of me.  As far as i know im the only person with spina bifida to make it through Infantry training.
Hillary is evil.
nah man, don't let it eat you
Oh it doesnt eat me at all
I have some many brothers that didn't get in or get their tabs
still harder than anyone I know
its a school
nothing more
point of pride.  ive done things since in my life that proves, at least to me, i would have made it fine and im calm under pressure
When shit hits the ability to think is an asset
the only thing about being a Ranger thats great is actually serving at Bn
and they grow their own
I was supposed to go to the 2nd
I had stripes from the Corps and coming into the Army, so I wasn't allowed at Ranger Bn
they only allow guys to grow up in Bn for the last 10 or 15 years now
E4 or below only can go to Ranger Bn now
well when I was in before retirement
'now they are scraping the bottom
even for SEALS and SF
Transgender warriors
when you and I first joined
when the army actually wore green and were men
They treated us like animals
they had 4 phases of ranger
I got hit and smacked routinely
and I didn't get mad over it
you couldnt get mad. there is a REASON for it
I knew those officers and NCOS cared about me
and I was a dumbass kid
If getting smacked makes you mad and makes you lose your calmness than you lose the ability to think
my old 1SGs and PSGS used to tell me about Vietnam
You freeze, you become careless, you take it personal
and actually teach me
I was scared shitless of my old PSG, until we had a beer, I was 19, and he taught how to walk inside a mortar umbrella
he had a BSV,ARCOM w/v, and afew PHs
Good morning Patriots!

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
and he showed me how to run a real patrol
but he saw I actually gave a shit
Its how one stays alive
he just let the team leaders and squad leaders smoke the shit out of me when I fucked up
As the Germans said, sweat saves blood
Hold steady, things are picking up. False flag attacks are ramping up.
but they never papered worked me, never had an ar15
yeah truly
I aged with Hog she has a slant to say the least. Who knows what is happening behind the scenes and smoke being blown by the lame ass media. One they will piss off enough people‚Ä¶.
the Krauts were damn good
my grandpapa smoked plenty of them,
Mine too lol but respected them
yeah, but mine hated the japanese
held no hatred. Just said they were kids doing what they were told to do as well
Japs, as most asians are at war, are nasty people
he fought in both, he was regular army then
one of the few
Army did serve in the Pacific
he did Europe and the Pacific
Mine Europe.  Got shot and blown up Hurtgen forest, healed than occupation duty
he actually fought with the Chinese and British too
he was army air corps
flying tiger
and eagle squadron
Ah that explains it
he had a silver star, 2 BSVs, and 4 PHS
a DFC and a but load of air medals
Voted Clinton?
one of the very few enlisted fighter pilots
my grand, hell no
Volunteers were they not?
He loved JFK
Well, JFK would be called a nazi today.  oh and a racist
but he said that was the last democrat worth a shit, his words
he passed afew years ago
JFK was WW2 as well.  Grandpa respected FDR but not his domestic policies
mine too.
last of my relatives that died in war, was Dustin Wright,
you know who he was?
you know Toombs county?
do you remember those green berets killed in Africa years back?
on video?
That was my cousin
they ran off and left our  men?
Look Up Dustin Wright SSG
Toombs County funeral
He received the SS
should have been the MOH
was that in nigeria ?
around those parts
helmet cam shows one getting shot and they walk up and unload on  him?
he was wounded many times, but he carried all of his teammates for about 5 hrs
and kept fighting
peeling, until they died
he evetually died from his wounds and bled out
but you can look it up and find it
i am now
thats my SF baby cousin, he enlisted for grp
there was a different one. vid from one of our guys getting shot
died a great hero
totally deserved the MOH
but the SS is pretty awesome
im watching it already!
Another hit piece it seems. Patriotism is NOT extreme. The variety of backgrounds should indicate that but of course they don‚Äôt
yeah brother thats it
thats our football field where they did they did the funeral
toombs county bulldogs
so you know I'm not BS'ing you
my mama's name is wright
Yeah I've had quite the career
I knew all the guys from band of brothers and some of the greatest american warriors in history bro
they are all grunts, just like you and me
If you make it to Georgia come on over and raise a glass in their Honoir
I'm actually planning on coming back home
I really want out of here bro
its great out west
Come back to where things are green
but there aren't many patriots
the only thing I'm worried about out there
there are so many brown people that are so angry
don't get me wrong, I'm not racist or mean
I don't want to be canabalized by angry brown folks
Its not the color, its the situation.
I'm part African
Scottish, Scandinavian here
but they aren't gonna see past my red skin and blue eyes and blondish hair
me too
No they are not
with a smattering of African and Jewish
Peace be with you
everyone calls me black viking
cause I turn red Like native american
im  just a Crack'a
with blond hair and blue eyes
You know, i tan well for a blonde. Golden brown. A real Adonis
your a transplant yankee
oh i know.  thing is my bro who lives in Wisconsin says i sound like i am from the south.  so be it
nah my family has literally been here since the late 1600s
well your there now
that land in Georgia since earl;y 1700s
early 1800;s for us.  Came over with all the other scottish
Gen. Sherman literally stayed in my families home outside of Atlanta
and burned it
after they raped and killed everything in sight
and guess what, we never owned slaves
and i have the papers to prove it
Most did not own slaves. wifes family didnt as well
too poor
we got fucked
It was war
we had money, we werent poor,
With no Geneva convention
but we were big land owners
werent stupid rich or anything
just share cropped land
collected alittle from what we had
I still have afew confederate bills from my folks
black freemen even lived in the ''big'' house with us
all true
Her family worked at whatever, picked cotton in the fields worked the mills in Columbus Ga
When slaves were freed many rushed up north and were hired for industry as less than half the wages you could hire a white person(sound familiar)
My aunt Betsie was the last of the black side of her kin that lived with us
she died when I was a boy
my grand with the wrights, and mom,they were close
When i moved to the South there was still that old Pride. Not racism, just Pride.  The past few decades with the importation of ghetto culture and meth that has been all but erased.
as a small boy I didnt understand, I was like, I'm kin to this old black woman, what?
yeah thats horrible, but its deep now, drugs, and all
Very very bad. WV is actually much worse
I won't lie I do have some Ku Klux types in the wood pile
but they were never overtly bad
wasn't like civil rights stuff
it was mostly turn of century ww1 time frame
my grand, the Vet
was always so good to black folks
my mom and dad were too, my mom was the greatest
Dont know anyone in her family who was.  Stone Mountain, where the Klan started, is now over 70% black.  Last year we had a huge black militant march there.  Down the road with around 300 holding rifles.
my grand is still alive in her ninties
she advocated for black educated
The area i grew up in Cleveland-when i wasnt in foster homes-was majority black and pretty rough.
Blacks should be educated,  not what we are seeing the Dems do to them in the cities.
and ran books for the local school system until afew years ago to educated black kids
yeah no shit
well plenty of african americans know whats up
all my black friends in uniform ive talked to are right wing
but thats grunts
Now that misery is what Dems are trying to spread across the usa.  blame white people for their bad governance.  Between the abortions in the ghettos and the violence its a holocaust of death.  In one year more murdered than 10 years of casualties in war
growing up in the south, until highschool, I never even heard the word N$$er until I left the south
and I was like, people say that?
I hears that in the city all the times. They called each other that and gorillas and everything else.  Of course i heard honkey, cracker.  Than there were spics, dago's, WOPS, Mickeys...
Yeah, I didn't hear any of that in the south growing up
City was a blending pot of every one from everywhere.
Heebs, krauts
I remember seeing Klan for the first time
and I was like, what is that
So many Catholics we had fish on fridays in school.
Never saw them.
in Toombs County we ran them out in the 80s
Knew some fellows in W.A.R (white aryan resistance) Had no idea until one day went to his house and a few came over.
I figures by the time i came to the south the klan was full of old bitter men
my Uncle Frank and Howard pulled their 38s and 30/30s out one time, first time I saw them protesting
they cocked and local cops joined in
loads of yelling
heard alot of get the hell out of here
'you aint welcome
I didnt know what the hell was going on
how old were you?
my Uncles just said dont worry
I was about 11 or 12
I asked my mom
she said its just a bunch of assholes with eyeholes in their bedsheets
I remember asking her, why would anyone cut their sheets
its madness, yet the same things the Klan said and did we are seeing the Dems doing yet again.  Race, skin color, calling whites subhuman, mob mentality.  Even calling blacks race traitors!
They jsut took the book, replaced "black" with "white"
yeah that is true
Human nature is still the same no matter the race.
So it works
part of the history
but at the same time, people forget theres been alot of different Klan stuff
and different orgs
none of it has been the same people or identity
it used to be massive
I was talking about hate groups with one of latino friends I served with
at one time it was massive
as far as Klan
but it was political, ain't alcohol
very conservative
but that klan died within years
because people werent racist
then we got new klans
like no one looks up nathan beford forest
and sees how good he was and what he became
or RE LEE,
TJ Jackson
these werent assholes
Lees work on reconciliation after the civil war has been erased
but what he was as a man in general
any of these men
lee and jackson were the first men in america to give so much to africans
forest became a christian and his former slaves loved him and said he was great even through the war
Erased from history. intentionally
Im not saying anything along those lines is good or okay,
forest's PSD was black men in gray
men with loads rifles, pistols
if he was a cunt, the first I would have done is shot him off his horse and left, horse make tracks
Of course!
go read this book
Erased.  Than the confederate flag, Gadsden flag and now the American flag
forest, first with the most
his own words on the klan
will do!
he talks about how lawless the south was after the war
Now i have heard that. vigilante groups too
and even men from your country in ohio came back and lived with him
and the free slaves were paid good wages
calvary leaders from the north
people revered forest
my God, his grandson died and his line ended over the skies of Germany in WW2
Than we look around at america today
General nathan b. forest III died bombing Nazi germany

Sniffy Xiden did not "unleash" anything, except to follow orders from the Deep State.

Step One:  The Plandemic destroyed tens-of-thousands of small businesses, which supplies approximately 72% of American jobs.

Step Two:  Pay people to stay at home creating a serious labor shortage, which destroys more small businesses

Step Three:  When American small business are all but destroyed, stop paying people to stay at home

Result:  People with no money and no job opportunities, all while destroying America's food/water production and infrastructure.

Hey Brother. Convention of States is holding a rally in Lansing at the State Capitol this Thursday June 10th from 11am to 2 pm. I'm going to have to take the THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT effort into the mix as well. I've neither encouraged or discouraged the Convention people, due to my personal belief that there is nothing wrong with the Constitution, only the people in office. To crack open the Constitution for reinterpretation is a can of worms I don't envy seeing. People unworthy of trust need to be outed and eliminated from government first. Which is where I'm at.....
Off to Lansing to the State Capitol again. Convention of States rally June 10th from 11 am to 2 pm. Take my THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT effort into the mix!
Hey Chris, I agree with your take on this. I used to be all for it, but after you made me realize the danger in attempting it at this time in our government's corrupted state it would be far too dangerous!

I contacted the author of this article/missive and informed him that a *Felon* is one who commits a *Felony* (i.e. breaking a particular LAW(s)) and has been adjudicated by a court-of-law with a guilty verdict.  A person who breaks a RULE is a BAD PERSON who does not obey the rules. (Excuse the poetic license of using the term bad person)   A rule must have the backing of a LAW (i.e. that which is passed by a legislative body and properly signed into law.)  A request was made to the author to correct his article/missive.  I am sure that there will never be a reply from the author.

I didn't know you spent time as a recruiter.  So, maybe you can give me an opinion?

I was on my bike in Marble Falls yesterday and parked in front of the Army Recruiting Station, which was next to my destination.  I got the idea to go in and tell them I want to reenlist, this time Army.  Yeah, I am pushing 75, but still can outdo most 30-year olds (for example last two years:  shoveled and wheelbarrowed and spread 58,000 lbs of river rock...shoveled and wheelbarrowed and rolled 21,000 lbs of decomposed granite and then laid the artificial turf...designed and built a large split-level deck for an elderly neighbor...we kids gotta take care of the elderly :rofl: ).

So do I get to sign on Da Bottom Line, or do I walk out with them rolling on the floor?
Are you available for quick phone call?
Lol that would be an age waiver for sure and be careful what you wish for! The Army and Marines would waiver just about anything from my experiences with them! When I could not out a kid in, they almost always did unless it was an issue at MEPS! 
You flew in Nam? What did you fly?
Did a JPAC tour in 2008 for 45 days at an F4 crash site north of Hanoi. Brought remains home after 4 previous digs did not find really anything 
I was not considered "smort nuff" to fly.  My training started after discharge and flew many years with Civil Air Patrol on Search and Rescue Missions.  My two backseat spotters were WWII B-17 pilots.  They were amazed that the US Air Farce did not consider smort nuff. I think they were discriminatory of Hogs. :rofl:

The Convention of States people had some speakers and maybe a couple hundred people came out to listen. A number of other causes from petitions to lawsuits wanting to sue the government. I didn't interrupt but spoke to those remaining after the rally was through. News stations are the next target. A man saw my sign and came up and used my bullhorn to inform the crowd there would be a Stop The Steal rally of some kind at the Capitol on the 17th. That is my stance, so I will look into it.
Hello sir!!
College major was Physics and minor was Math.  I soloed in six hours (Part 41). Started training for my Commercial (Part 135) before I got my Private, having completed all training for Private but had to add more hours, so added those hours practicing the required Commercial maneuvers, while taking Commercial Ground School.  At the same time started training for Instrument and Multi.  Returned from Air Farce back to IBM (Military Reinstatement) Field Engineering, where I spent 30-years being one of the few (approximately 3%) trained in both systems hardware and software (actually was trained hardware, but trained myself in all the internal system software.) I seriously considered a career in the Air Farce, until - beginning with my Recruiter - being treated like a dummy, which I still don't understand. Where I am still confused is that since they would not commit to OCS/Pilot, I chose Enlisted with a promise of electronics, that I wanted for my return to IBM.  They had given me four different entrance tests and aced all four.  When I got my orders for Tech School, was it Electronics, as promised?  NO!  It was Munitions and Weapons at Lowry AFB in Denver.  So, overseas I started taking Electronics Correspondence Courses, and finished one year prior to discharge.  All-in-all, the Air Farce has left me quite bitter, but still damn proud of my service and status as a Veteran.  Air Farce always said, "Aim High".  Maybe I should have requested to be an Astronaut? :rofl:

Went to Convention of States rally at the Capitol.  I didn't interrupt the speakers, supported some statements about We the People being the last real hope, but I never agreed with their cause. Opening up the Constitution for some sort of rewrite, with the same people in office who have twisted it beyond recognition waiting in the wings, is closer to insane than dangerous. There is nothing wrong with the Constitution, just the people we let represent us. At any rate, I had my say about never accepting the people in office because of cheating, to mainly favorable  responses. News stations next up...... I think your rally at the military base is this weekend, right...? Hope it goes well!

Good morning all!
Good American Morning Fellow Patriots! 
Dave i guess its just me and you man!!!
Seems like bro
Abbott is starting to come alive and making some popular moves.  Why?  I believe it has to do with the announcement by the Texas GOP Chair, LtCol Allen West, that he is stepping down as Chair and strongly considering a run for Governor.
Agree Hog. Need Lt Col West back in office 
I'm behind Lt Col West all the way! 
He's the kind we need a lot more of in leadership positions in our government! 
But I'm also for our border states taking control of this dictators mishandling of the border! They should all step up and finish the wall themselves! 
Anyone who doesn‚Äôt go beyond Col I can get behind. Means they didn‚Äôt swallow the Kool Aid
What we need in Texas is a damn strong Patriot Lt Gov.  Here in Texas it is the Lt Gov that has all the power, unfortunately.  Dan Patrick has been barely acceptable, at best.
I've washed my hands of the entire mess and moved on with life.  Until someone of power says get your guns and come join the army to save America, I'm done with the stress.  Life is to short for ongoing BS and complaining.
I am for Allen West all the way but no go on Patrick. Thinking he might be borderline rino. Y‚Äôall are correct about Abbott he‚Äôs stepping up his game moving towards election time.

Was just about to post Mikes interview with Nyquist when Hog put it up...
:confounded: While I do support LtCol West, there exists a frustration with him.

Summer of 2019 we both attended the Burnet County GOP Picnic.  After his speech, we had about a fifteen minute discussion.  I expressed the concern that he is always warning about "Socialism", both in speeches and TeeVee interviews.  This heading into the 2020 Election season.

I attempted to impress upon him that it is NOT Socialism, but a flat-out invasion of Communism, which started in 1950s America with the 1848 Communist Manifesto of Marx and Engels as the playbook.  I strongly suggested that he look at the 1950s list of Communist objectives for the destruction of The Republic, with 48 items completed and the final two coming to fruition. The Commies were hiding behind the facade of Socialism.

Subsequent to our conversation he continued to warn about the Socialist Agenda, including his emails as the Chair of The Texas GOP. I sent numerous emails reminding him about our conversation and asked if he had researched what was presented to him.  Never replied.

Okay, so let me see if I understand this. :thinking:   Numerous objective doctors/researchers/labs/etc have all but labeled the Gene Altering substance (not Vaccine) *The Death Stab*, but the FDA is concerned about a contamination problem?  The fact that some world-renowned and Nobel Prize recipients have stated that vaxxed people will either die within 6-24 months, or be incapacitated with life-long ailments is of no concern to the FDA, and labels such as Conspiracy Theory (yeah, like that is original) are applied. :face_with_raised_eyebrow: 

In a statement the FDA said, with a straight face, _"...considering the current COVID-19 public health emergency, :confounded: the FDA concluded these batches are suitable for use."_

She‚Äôs a hack!
Stupid more proof this is not what it seems! Nothing to see here folks, line up to get your shot so we can control the population 
Yeah that looked suspicious. I wonder if they just added a mic to make it look like he is being covered more than he is
We should not put all hope on 1 man but cannot disagree!
GPS doesn't transmit. It determines your location. Your radio transmits at whatever frequency your radio is tuned to. If there was any type of "bug", it would be to off-tune to a pre-determined frequency and transmit your location to whoever is receiving.
Good morning all Oath Keepers!

bravo-echo, you are correct I should have said locator beacon or something like that. Would only transmit when the mic is keyed.
How stupid. Biden is an asshat supreme‚Ä¶.period. I don‚Äôt see how even the lefties can support him anymore OR in the first place‚Ä¶.what a joke
It is possible that something could transmit location as soon as you power on. It could send a quieter hidden signal that you cannot notice but when looked for can be found. Either way I was wondering if there may be something to track us since they are made in China and we all seem to have the intention of using them if SHTF

I have not and was wondering that as well. Ever since that dust up he seems to have gone dark
He and I communicated several times both during and after.  He did say that he was going to take a breather from the RC, but we still communicated several times after that.  This is weird and troublesome.
Well I hope he is ok. His fears he expressed during the blow up were troubling to say the least

Word coming from military crash truck firefighters at recent air show are reporting that current deployment and similar orders and associated military documents are signed by DJT. Hmmm...
Ron, that sure would be great news, it would lend credence to the stories that Trump is still in charge of the military! 
But I can't think of a situation where a president would be signing military orders, shorting a declaration of war? Troop movement orders are signed by regional commanders, generals, Secretary of Defense, etc.
I would like someone to publicize these supposed orders with Trumps signature!
Good American Morning Patriots! 
Info came by word of mouth from fellow FF's who rotated through the air show with a flight crew crash truck. If the IA was singed before 1/20 SOP may be skewed.  :eyeglasses:
Would the IA be considered an internal war?
At this point we can only hope that he still holds power over our military! But the clock is ticking towards that purported Aug date that is mentioned in talks of his comeback! 
Right, a date check on the IA is in order!

Are you the Ron from FL and NJ that windy spoke of?

So many Ron's! Yo must then be the one Kait has mentioned to me?

I, and many others, still believe that on the morning of January 20th Real President Trump signed The Insurrection Act.  Some of us also believe that he told Sniffy of the signing in the private note left for him in the Oval Office. (Not that Sniffy has ever been in the real Oval Office, but he got the note). 

In my opinion, since the military is operating under The Insurrection Act, Real President Trump is the authorized/legal signer.
Time to head out for the day. Will check in as I am able.

It seems clear that most members don't care to expose themselves here after it became obvious that we are clearly under attack and this platform represents an avenue for the bad actors to single out targets, overall strategy and tactics. Activity here is no longer the same as it was. However it is my belief that many check in to look for critical updates or a call to action (Now-Here-This).  Until there is a clear direction to take action on an overt national stage I believe everyone should continue building local support and get involved in local politics such as school boards, city counsels, Board of supervisors and such. Meet and greet to vet in person and keep all things on the up and up. Steer clear from anyone who pushes otherwise! That is to hold the line and begin taking back our communities by supporting the good guys and removing the bad actors from position of power and replace with patriots. There will come a day in the near future when this tactic will pay off if every part of our country acts in this fashion.  Ultimately every small town, City, County and State will need to stand up to defend their neighbor's and leaders who stand for truth, equal justice for all, law and order without a two tier system where politicians are above the law or to big to fail corps are allowed to continue to break the law and rape our country, It starts on the local level to hold accountable our elected officials and their appointed bureaucrats. Listen to General Flynn's call to action! Look at what Pompeo has to say.  Might be quiet here but we must look and listen for things that we can do at the local level. Protect, defend and stand alongside the citizens who are on the front line of this movement.  IMHO

Hang in there, Dranem. Many members on this forum left after Jan 6th, out of fear. And then there were some who left out of frustration and impatience the org and leadership were not taking a more aggressive stand against the 2020 Marxist election coup. Of those who remain active on this forum, either as readers or writers, many await the AZ election audit results and those of like-minded states.

Hello fellow American and patriot:  I got a text to meet in Athens but can't this time of year because of HVAC calls. Can meet anywhere in Madison County.  McDonalds on Winchester road would be perfect I would like to meet the nearest member to my address. Thanks Ricky O.
And do not be lulled into thinking they may not do anything. That would be intentional on their part if you ask me
You hear from Madmarine4212 recently?
No sir. The last time was about a month ago. He called me all jacked up about building a training range and he was asking me to invest $200K.
That wasn't going to happen, even if I had the money! 
Ditto.   Same here. Asked alot of questions, some personal.  Mentioned you were a good to go person.  Since we spoke he went dark. Will not answer in Signal as well.
We spoke on the phone
Talked about me selling and moving out, and ya building a range
Hmm. He seems like he's coming from a place of Patriotism and highly motivated but I will tell you that he would not give his personal data required for vetting so he was passed over.
Perhaps.   .."he would not give his personal data required for vetting so he was passed over."      What?
That is kind of personal info, so please don't repeat? 
He would rapid fire ask me questions such as what my wife did for a living
Of course.  Just when a guy contacts me from this chat, asks Q's, talks about DC than disappears it makes me a bit....cautious
Yes, but he almost comes across like he's on drugs. Way to hiper!
A bit lol.   You and i have DM'ed on here in the past.  He was new to me, and when he mentioned you by name than disappeared i thought i would touch base with you.
The morning he called me it was 7 am my time and I think 4 am in AZ where he supposedly lives. A pretty odd time to be calling and asking for an investment like that!
My ass is in bed at 4am.
I got the lowdown on him directly from Kait. FN9. She felt it out of place that he was acting like he was vetting her and then when he refused to pass on his DD214 and other required docs, she shut his vetting down.
I have had people call me before like this. People i knew, hadnt heard from in a while.  Wanting money, or something.......and its usually not good. So my ears perked up.  I dont know him well enough to suggest anything, but you dont cold call someone, talk about being Infantry, make a connection than ask for money.  He wanted me to sell and MOVE
Roger that.  Its a vibe.....something doesnt seem right.
Same here. I told him the only place my wife would let me move to would be Connecticut so we would be near our other daughter and son inlaw. Have to be near our kids in one place or the other.
How odd.....
Same M.O on me
How comfortable are you talking with Kait?
She should be brought up to speed on him
DM? ya fine.  What i told you is pretty much what i would tell her.   He said he knew the guy  from FB Keating in Afghanistan too
If your OK with it you should shoot her a Signal text. Or DM her but this is not encrypted! 
Whats her signal then?
One sec.
I'm going to delete this right away so screen save or right down! 

Thanks for reaching out. Keep your head down 
Hi everyone. Kinda vented last night without really making my point. And that is that I think OK has the potential to be a truly great organization. And a huge benefit to the the people of this once (and hopefully again soon) great nation. And right now just being a flag to muster under isn't enough to help with recruiting. And yes DaveyE7 every time I see that shit I want to puke. I never believed that my children and grandchildren would ever have to have that disgusting shit crammed down their throats every damn day. But anyway I am solid with OK I really wish there was something to show potential members.
Good deal. DaveyE7 and I were just discussing this subject. It's odd that they would even keep someone in the loop if they are not willing to give their DD214
Totally agree. One of the things we are doing here is bouncing ideas and venting and keeping each other informed as well as keeping spirits and solidarity up among those that are hanging in here. We will come to that day when something will be done, what remains to be seen. I have been waiting 8 years with OK and others have been with OK even longer so we get it!
DaveyE7 here. Contact me on my ProtonMail account: DaveyE7@protonmail.com. We are all on Signal as well
Talking with each other
dranem, 
You make a valuable point and I am with you that we could be and should be much more! Most especially under the current circumstances our Country faces! 
And as much as my budy DaveyE7 also makes a valid point, that was then and this is now! And now is a F-d up time and place that calls for us to ‚ÄúImprovise, Adapt, and Overcome‚Äù!
ssgtgman,
I guess for the time being we do need to overcome and adapt. But I sure would like to see our wonderful country return to the high moral foundation that made us the envy of the planet. 
dranem,
Yes sir, this Country's moral core has been and is being dismantled by the hard left and their communist ideologies! 
Society has gone to hell in a quick hurry!

Hey John,
ssgtgman here. 
I'm touching base with you because my budy DaveyE7 is down your way somewhere visiting family and it's not like him to not get back to me within a couple of hours. I haven't heard back from him since yesterday at 6:45pm.
I'm probably just being paranoid but with that building collapse I'm worried he may have been there!
Or maybe he's joined up with you to help out and just hasn't had a chance to charge his cell?
I would appreciate you getting back to me?
Thank you kindly, 
Gary
Good morning all Oath Keepers!
Getting back to you as soon as I got word. DaveyE7 was on the road back the NC all day. So nothing to worry about. 
Good American Morning Patriots! 
Antifa and BLM seem awful quiet right now. Wonder what they're cooking up in collaboration with DOJ/FBI to create a FALSE FLAG.

Preliminary results of the AZ election audit comes out in weeks. I agree with Gen. Flynn, the Left needs a false flag to distract. But a HUGE false flag. 
*Any thoughts? Speculation?*
I suspect the false flag may be directed at Trump's upcoming summer tour.  The Left needs to demonize Trump supporters and patriots in order to further shape their "white supremacist" "domestic terrorists" narrative. 

For example, the FBI may arrest Trump during his America tour, provoking a heated response by Trump supporters. In that heated response, "unindicted co-conspirators" will lead the charge.

https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/06/gen-michael-flynn-something-going-happen-must-create-noise-arizona-audit-going-something-video/
They are very good at making lots of small issues if they don‚Äôt have a big one. Gun violence, covid, pelosi‚Äôs commission on Jan. 6, etc.,etc., etc.  Not only antifa and blm being quiet but Obama and Clinton (the one‚Äôs telling Biden what to do and say) are quiet also. Even a lot of the dems in office now are pretty quiet.      City of San Francisco just put out that city employees must have vaccine buy end of July or be fired. So they are slowly trying to chip away at this country. 
Flynn is making a good prediction.  The left keeps distracting the public each time something is about to surface that will turn people against them.
Afternoon my god believing non-perverted, brave constitution loving red blood americans who will defeat all socialist beings who are guilty of treason against the USA, period . Have a good day my brothers and sisters.
You as well sir

Good morning all Oath Keepers! The article above is spot on and the call for all veterans to be ready should be heeded! I am preaching to the choir I know but this is why this platform important as are all the other alternate comms 
I had heard of these 2 counties doing this. Very rural counties away from Las Vegas but it is an encouraging start! Apparently more are negotiating with CSPOA
Sorry -- just saw this msg --- good to hear all is well.
All good, thanks for touching base. 
I hope you haven't lost anyone in this disaster! And I imagine if we weren't under the virtual attack by the feds that you and your members in Florida would be there supporting the rescue effort.
I don't mean virtual in an abstract way. They are hands on and breaking their oaths on a regular basis. That 73 year old pastor and Nam vet that they arrested the other day for instance! So we can't exercise our 1st amendment rights without the threat of being locked up by the Gestapo! Yet at the same time they let the ant & blm dushbags off of all charges for truly violent crimes!
Thanks,  No OK in this disaster.  Actually only a couple current members in Miami area.   Thought about a CTA but local officials seem to have a good handle on this now.   Hope all are found safe.
Keep the faith! 
Anyone having trouble with Signal?  My power went out briefly and after the restart, Signal won't open/come up.  Just my trouble??
I'm re-downloading to the computer, working well on the phone.  Nevermind.
Good morning all Oath Keepers! No issues with Signal last night @rev-mike

Good morning all Oath Keepers! Stay vigilant. The hot summer is just beginning‚Ä¶.
Good Morning my fellow Oath Keepers! 
This past Saturday was a crazy one! Just down the street from my house we lost two outstanding members of our little community! A retired state trooper who was a good friend of my wife from the gym and a retired AirForce SSGT to a crazed gunman who was also from our town. 
I salute the two victims and pray for their piece and for their family's recovery from this senseless attack. üá∫üá∏üôè
I saw it on the news. Terribly sad.
Tragic. We mourn the loss of a brother and sister in arms. Prayers for sure for their families. As ssgtgman knows that isn‚Äôt far from some of my family either‚Ä¶.
I knew the military was not on his side when he needed to invoke the Insurrection Act

Hey John. What happened to retired Capt. Chauncey Normandin . Florida Chapter President. Vice President, Chapter Affairs....?
gre81 about China warning: Belt Road Initiative  is Xi masterpiece sold as infrastructure to build economic ties. In reality creates indebtedness to China from many other totalitarian regimes because they couldn't get the help their countries need elsewhere, but it locks them in with debt, technology, and military assistance and allegiance, to Chinese and not compatible with the U.S. Since 2013, most nations on Earth, including Russia, linked fully or in part, terms not disclosed as China not tied to international banking protocols, and who are all in threat of default due to economic impact of covid shutdowns, a virus that came from China.......Plandemic is looking like the right word, whether outright or after the fact....Yeah, and the infrastructure being built will support huge economic and military situation controlled by China. Beholden to China, and China be holding all the cards. The purchased politicians in DC and nationwide must be replaced. We have umpteen intelligence agencies and they in sum completely missed this......fat chance, friends!
Another of countless examples of Unconstitutional activity directed at American citizens within our government. If the Pentagon is full of officers who are sworn to defend the Constitution over their chain of command, the President and Congress quite literally, what is to be said of the sad state of affairs this country and its citizens are facing, when all of them amount to nothing more than purchased politicians and political hacks....? No Constitution, no Uniform Code of Military Justice....wtf....?
Exactly wildman! We know what this is about and it‚Äôs not extremism. Loving ones country and serving it for patriotic reasons is not extremism‚Ä¶..the asshats at the five sided puzzle palace forget that in their rush to get promoted‚Ä¶.

Good morning all Oath Keepers! Damn it‚Äôs early!!!
Could be a "coincidence"...I have flown twice since Jan 6th (I did not take part in any way) and even though I am TSA PRE and Global Entry vetted and approved, I have NOT received the TSA PRE designation on my boarding passes with two different airlines.  One was for domestic travel and the other was for International (MX).  I asked one airline why I was not TSA PRE and they said "It's up to TSA.  Ask them." So I asked the TSA rep and he said, "It's the airline and not TSA who controls it."  Why am I surprised at this...anyway, anyone else experience this??
I should mention that I am current and up-to-date with TSA PRE and Global Entry Enrollment.

The floodgates of truth are opening and time to keep head on swivel is here. FF pointed at us continues. :hourglass_flowing_sand:
He tried to call me this AM but i didnt have my Signal on
He texted me twice on Signal this morning. I didn't answer him. On Kait's advice I blocked him on my phone. Didn't realize that I had to separately block him on Signal? He then tried to call me but it was rejected. Then I put the block on Signal also.
I wish I knew what his game is, a fed, or a messed up vet?
tx2a, That's messed up brother!
I think we are all marked. Weather OK or even just a Republican! 
Tx2a, I‚Äôve had TSA pre-ck from even before the Trump presidency. I can only remember once not being given that designation. When I inquired w the TSA, they said they did that sometimes randomly. Now, do I aniticipate at some point soon going on the no-fly list just because I‚Äôm an OK? Absolutely.
I was on my way back to Iraq Dec 2003 from a 2 week R&R in full desert BDUs with military travel orders and I got the boots off, top off and full patdown! 
Yup, thanks for your service, my ass!
They tried blaming it on random search procedures! F that shit!
Lol, ya. I‚Äôve seen some pretty irrational things at the airport, but they were in the yrs after 9/11; I gotta say, TSA has gotten more relaxed in the last few yrs.
TSA = The Stupidest Agency ever. They are flat out morons and asshats. I have had several run ins with them, same thing, on military orders, not on orders, always the same. Right after 9-11 flew to Europe to see my daughters and that‚Äôs when they did checks at security entry point and the gate. Every flight except at the European airport for the full search/check at each point, while the Muslim with family in the corner praying to Mecca were left alone. Each time I slammed my military ID down and asked if they were satisfied to be messing with me. No damn sound judgement in the lot. Common sense is not common amongst many people for a long time now‚Ä¶.
The TSA is nothing more than "Security Theater" with a bunch of very bad, less than D-List actors.  They are simply there to make your average sheeple feel safe and to help the stay calm.  So, basically, we pay quite a bit of tax money to give the sheeple a placebo.
Exactly. The first TSA agents were the ones on duty the day of 9-11 in some airports. That makes sense‚Ä¶.
Good morning Oath Keepers! Have a safe weekend, stay alert

Good afternoon fellow patriots.
What‚Äôs up, brother!
Any word on what happen in Massachusetts this morning? A stand off with Militia and police on Rt95
Yep, 11 heavily armed guys from a peace-loving group called ‚ÄúRise of the Moors‚Äù were on the way from RI to ME for training this fine July 4th weekend when they pulled over on I95 and, after telling the state trooper they didn‚Äôt recognize the laws of the US, were, after a ‚Äústandoff‚Äù, detained. Check out the story at breirbart.com‚Äî not sure the state propaganda machine will cover it.
Good morning all Oath Keepers and Patriots! Enjoy this Independence Day. Pray it is not our last one‚Ä¶.
Good 4th of July Morning Patriots 
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Declaration of Independence. Freedom from tyrannical government for.....We The People! Novel concept, this is definitely something the American citizens should consider. The Give Me Freedom Or Give Me Death slogan really catchy, don't you think....? Happy Independence Day! Guess I never once considered that our freedoms might include being free from the responsibility we all share in regard to protecting those freedoms. When we locate the other what must add up to 20 million veterans and military members who took an oath to protect this nation from enemies foreign and domestic and they join the 30 some thousand here who thought it was of major significance OUR ENTIRE LIVES, let me know......? Appreciate it!
May you all have a great Independence Day!

Overall yesterday seems to be very quiet. Maybe too quiet...
Correct, Ron. The enemies of the Republic are always active.
Check out that YouTube above about 9 July. Posted by ssgtgman a perfect opportunity under the guise of an exercise to do some damage and drive a wedge deeper between We The People
And Good Morning all Oath Keepers! 
Has anyone heard from Stuart Rhodes since the second Revolver article citing him as a likely government agent? Has he refuted it? After the first Revolver article on Jan 6th he was in an interview that was posted on here where he said he will probably be indicted.
Yes andyjack
SR will be posting on our website regarding the Revolver nonsense.    Should be there by EOD tomorrow.    All will be encouraged to share it once available.
I would be very interested in knowing more about Darren Beattie(Revolver news). It says in this article that he now works for the Biden Admin.
Just noticed the article is dated July 6th 2021. Are we time traveling now?
No clue who edailybuzz is

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Following is a post by another patriot from another web site that I think is worth a quick read. However we don't seem to have many keyboard warriors here since the capitol incident.
"We do not want to move into a judge mental position. But for all of you keyboard warriors that are complacent If your not growing the protectiveness of your community and homeland well you really need to seriously think about leaving this site and going to something a little less obtrusive. Think about what this website has had to persevere through and with the admin‚Äòs have had to go through. Perhaps you‚Äôll become overly complacent due to social media judge mental degradation towards God-fearing patriots. If that‚Äôs the case then you are nothing more then the Fairweather patriot. You should honestly remove yourself and go back to your sleepy Hollow where are you are safe in your mind yet setting yourself up for total enslavement. Lawful assemblance with constitutional directives is not illegal. Complacency to progressive ideology is in fact slavery. The pussafacatiom of men and today‚Äôs culture of fear of being blacklisted is nothing more than cowardice. We are here to defend freedom. To prepare people and eventuality of unforeseen catastrophe. Get off your lazy ass, step out of your chair and away from your keyboard and become a part of the solution not the problem. You‚Äôll be OK. "
He‚Äôs not wrong that‚Äôs for sure
We the people are under attack from many angles. The first amendment is under a constant barrage of censorship and demonization of truth tellers. Choosing silence is surrender and defeat. Truth must be spoken and defended. Sharing news with links to information on the internet is critical. However, this is a week point when information fails to reach critical mass.
Grass roots community gatherings are the bottom up solutions that need to be primed, fueled, then throttle up the truth. and wake up the sleepers.  Some people can see. Some people can see when shown and some people will never see. Triage!
Standing shoulder to shoulder or hold the six with anyone placing themselves in the spotlight is a good way to get involved.
This site has posted many points to reinforce this method of defense (before it was taken down).
Taken down twice because they do not want patriots to gather strength.
Every community, large or small that strengthens and prepares for the hardships to come will fair much better than those who buy into the propaganda and lies of the talking heads on MSM.
We can not shy away from speaking out the truth and help wake up the people. Start locally and continue to support those in the national spotlight.
This is just one of many ways we can protect Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.
We must not forget it is critical not to stray from exhausting all methods of lawful conduct and  solutions. Otherwise we will be in the wrong. I believe that there will come a time when bad actors will escalate attacks upon innocent people will bring things to the point where an equal reaction to attacks will become unavoidable. Prepare.
Excellent words Ron! This site has been more and more silent. Time to stand and do what we are legally and God given able to do!
It is my guess that many patriots visit this site but now exercise OPSEC on the internet. Remember all methods of coms are compromised. Only face to face with no electronics anywhere around. Best to be nowhere around anything electronic.
Just found this:    https://allnewspipeline.com/Antifa_Explodes_In_Violence_Over_Peaceful.php
The objective is to preserve the Republic in a peaceful, legal way.
If the videos in the link above don't make you angry you are not paying attention.
BOTTOM LINE


There so many results when searching video platforms for "Wi Spa," people getting beaten and terrorized for doing nothing but using their constitutional right to protest peacefully, and this is just the latest of evidence of how Antifa groups are not a myth, or an "idea" or a vast right-wing conspiracy, as the evidence is on video.

More and more peaceful, non-violent protesters are being verbally and physically attacked by violent Antifa terrorists in an attempt to intimidate others into staying silent.   

What is needed are volunteer protection details, to do nothing but show up at  protests to surround and protect the innocent peaceful protesters.

As long as they do not throw any first punches, they will be well within their rights to defend themselves and those they are offering protection to.

If Antifa can organize to show up at all these peaceful protests, free speech rallies, etc... then certainly other groups can organize even better (after all, Antifa isn't exactly full of mensas), and protect those trying to protect our nation's children,  and others from being violently attacked by Antifa.

If the police in these liberal cities are not being allowed to do their jobs, then a civilian group is needed to do it for them and protect those that come in peace, just to be attacked by Antifa.
Not in my town! Not on my watch!
Together we are strong. Divided we are week. We the People.  :flag_us:

Everyone disappeared, not a single shot fired. So....no need to wonder about the disrespect and minimal concern the media driven left has for the conservative minded patriots. Formidable, in theory, non-existent ,in reality...? The government won't have to worry how they will grab the bull by the balls if the bull has no balls....They can just let it wander aimlessly, and harmlessly, without as much as a thought, while they busy themselves revising the flock mindset with indoctrination and fear....not as much as a blip on the radar, nor a bump in the road. I distinctly remember the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines as being highly mobile operations capable and willing to take the fight to our enemies wherever they might be....? Well shit, I drove to DC from MIchigan  in just under 8 hours. State capitols are even closer.... Does anyone wait until their car tire is completely out of air before filling it back up.....or wait until their lawn becomes a forest before cutting it.....? Usually you pay attention to the things going on in your life, and when it comes to the integral routine maintenance, you STOP EVERYTHING AND HANDLE IT! When...? WHENEVER! AND EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU NEED TO! Apparently our government having gone rogue is not that big of a deal. Give me liberty or give me death ...? That was the mindset of the people who fought, many dying, to create this country and its freedoms since enjoyed. Its been maintained by folks with the same fervent desire, in similar fashion, relentless and unstoppable. Today, we avoid each other, as we do the mirror, hoping, all the while. Hoping no one asks you anything, hoping this goes away, hoping your kids figure something out for themselves....something other than we dropped the ball causing their inheritance to be squandered. The only thing we were charged with doing, protecting a future they could then create for themselves, and pass on to their children in similar fashion. Without responsibility, integrity doesn't exist. And freedom won't either. Freedom is responsibilities child. Born of it, and nurtured by it. So I don't know, if Trump, or Stewart, aren't going to come to our nations rescue, does that mean we're shit out of luck....? I'll follow, or lead, either one is fine. But I will never ACT like I'm patiently doing something constructive in the meantime. I'm wondering WTF happened to the citizens of the greatest nation in the history of this planet, a beacon of light for all, truly blessed by God. I know He is wondering the same thing....
From Conservative Treehouse's article above: 
_In a remarkable display of how committed the Democrat party is to utilizing the narrative of domestic extremism for their own benefit, Nancy Pelosi is placing satellite field offices for the DC Capitol Police in key regions around the country. . . . In essence, the Florida and California offices of Pelosi‚Äôs police will direct the DOJ on who and where to target. . . . There‚Äôs no legislative or constitutional process for a subsidiary federal law enforcement agency to exist.  This appears to be a new construction outside the boundaries of the legislative branch, and quasi-constitutional from the framework of the executive branch. Essentially satellite DC police units. . . . The New York Police Department cannot set up a field office in Atlanta, Georgia, or Dallas, Texas; there is no jurisdictional authority that would permit it.  So, how can the DC police department arbitrarily operate field offices in states outside Washington DC jurisdiction?_

It's the TIMING that concerns me most. The DOJ and FBI have already been converted to political Gestapo; there is no need to expand DC Capitol police to the states to quell conservatives. So the real question is not a matter of WHY but a matter of WHEN. Why now? Is this connected to the soon-to-be released AZ paper ballot preliminary audit results?
Sundance addresses that point very well.:    "I will say it again‚Ä¶. stop and hear the drums‚Ä¶ Something is about to happen; federal agencies are acting in a very proactive manner.  This shift by Nancy Pelosi is yet another advance move in preparation for, or in defense of, something they are planning for.  Either they are doing something; fearful of us discovering something; or they are preparing for us to react to something and they are pre-positioning assets to defend against it.  They are all-in and it shows."
Can‚Äôt disagree with you so it falls to your own vetting. I am communicating with folks in here I have know about from the old platform for years as well as new folks just met here not long ago. Not sure what advice to give as far as vetting but if we stand and wait for a full fledged background check we will be further behind then we already are
Good morning all! Question came up how do we organize ourselves here on this site and on alternate platforms when we have little to no vetting. My answer is you have to go with your gut and communicate and be careful what you speak about until you feel you can trust that person. If we wait on a full fledged background check we will be further behind. Also, seeds of distrust is what the other side wants to sow within us. Stay vigilant and stay the course. Hold the line as we can now. That is all we can do
Good morning all!

Hey Jason,
I pulled my question off general thinking it might be more appropriate to ask you directly. 
Kait was working on the vetting process but her contact with the vetting specialist has dropped off.
Can you give an update on the vetting process, is it back up or still on hold?

Yes Jessie¬†Jane¬†Duff¬†is a kick ass Marine! She is on Newsmax regularly. 
Good Morning Keepers of the Oath!
She sure is! The Officer leadership needs to listen to the competent SNCO ‚Äòs
Informative article, the Gestapo are coming for sure!
As my daughter's (retired Marine Colonel) father in law put it. Once they they become general officers they become part of the political system that is dominated by libterds and most cave to the pressure and adopt their communist ideology!
They will use all means at their disposal especially now that Afghanistan is winding down. More assets will be available 
Yes exactly. Trade their souls for promotion and power
GOOD MORNING  FELLOW RED BLOODED AMERICANS WHO WILL SEE THAT, STEALING, CHEATING AND TREASONIST UNAMERICAN SATAN'S CHILDREN WILL NOT PREVAIL.
Afternoon Moonshine, 
Hey I am watching Newsmax and they have Jenny¬†Beth¬†Martin of Tea Party Patriots on as one of the guest hosts.
I joined them way back in the lead up to the 2010 election to fill Ted Kennedy's seat in Mass. Our guy Scott Brown one.
But I only just learned that she is a GA girl. She is really making a name for herself! 
Have you ever rubbed elbows with her?
Abso damn lutely!!!!!
How are things with you? I'm sure your busy when you have time if you will arrange a meeting with a member near me at around 6 pm or so. have a good one be safe.
Good morning all Oath Keeping Patriots! Stay strong hold the line!
Good American Morning! 
Or at least we were still in America the last time I checked. These demorats are really pushing their communist agenda!

I don't understand why there isn't a broad appeal to the other oath keepers. It is estimated there might be 35,000 of us joining Stewart. There are 18 million veterans in his country. That leaves at least 17,965,000 Constitutional Patriots with a military background unaccounted for. If we're to talk Situation, Mission, and Execution today, in this situation, our mission first and foremost should be recruiting. During the Civil War, that was Ulysses S. Grant's first job after returning from his fathers tannery. His famous line about there being only two parties: traitors and patriots. There is no political solution.There is no dialogue, just thousands of diametrically opposed editorials. Stewart doesn't need to fight this with a tiny group of Sons of Liberty. He'll win nothing. His advice to Trump about calling out the veterans is the same advice he needs to use himself. Transparency. The generals in the Pentagon and the Alphabet Agencies are purchased political hacks like the members of our Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of government.Propaganda, censorship, control, and surveillance. Cheating in elections and stacking the government branches to attain political dominance over the citizens, not to benefit them. Many of us still believe in liberty or death. Wasting that sentiment arguing with criminals who have no intention of recognizing us in any useful way is futile, if not insane as well. Sometimes, your thinking comes up empty and your muscles have to take over. 18 million people is a convincing gathering. Look how frightened DC got with the Jan.6 group of churchgoers. We can't outlast these tyrants in a game of hide and seek. People willing to unleash biological weapons on civilian populations...? It might not be the bloody carnage predicted. Bearing arms doesn't mean you HAVE to use them. It does let the enemy know, in no uncertain terms, that talk is cheap, and bullets are relatively inexpensive as well. Unprecedented. There is no model. Let's build one. In the open. Now. Tell Stewart I said hey!
What happens to the liberals if Abbott arrest them when they come back? Jail time, fine, or is it just lip service?

You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes. What responsible parent would involve their minor children in such an action? THAT only teaches stupidity and wreckless behavior. THAT does NOT teach the children how to be Patriots!
So, basically what needs to be done is those of us across the country need to donate a small percentage of our time and resources in support of the local HAM clubs so as to assure COMMS being available in the time of crisis.
What is "MOK"?
Good morning all Patriots!
"You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes. What responsible parent would involve their minor children in such an action? THAT only teaches stupidity and wreckless behavior. THAT does NOT teach the children how to be Patriots!"  --- @SCORPION 

What responsible parent would do such a thing? ME for one.  

I didn't travel to DC for the Trump rally, Jan. 6th. In fact, I thought the idea for a rally that week was ill conceived---too little too late. But had I been there as a private citizen (not as an Oath Keeper), you can bet your Boston Tea Party I would have been at and IN the Capitol Building that day. But that's just me, I guess.
With your children? Of course you do realize that we were NOT AT WAR against our government at the time either?
@SCORPION  I didn't and wouldn't bring babies, toddlers, or young children to political rallies. Too dangerous. But teens? Yes.
Ok, so what is your point to my original statement?
Teens are minors. The Munn family brought their teen (daughter, I think) with them to DC and into the Capitol Bldg. I would have done the same had I been there as a private citizen (not as on OKer).
Which is pretty damn stupid and dangerous for a parent to do, which could get you stripped of custody of the child for reckless endangerment, child abuse and a whole lot of other crap, which we will most likely see in the near future. Parents have lost EVERYTHING THEY OWN just for spanking their children.  To all else that is reading this diatribe, my message is THINK before you go running off into the hell of, "battle" or whetever you THINK is battle...  I know most of you are pissed-off and all patriot driven, but if you are not properly trained or do not have your head and ass wired together, the best course of action is inaction until you KNOW WTF you are doing!  Our military doesn't just drop troops on the ground in foreign countries to aid the oppressed until they spend MONTHS, even YEARS of intel gathering.  USE YOUR HEADS!
"[Y]ou do realize that we were NOT AT WAR against our government at the time either" --- @SCORPION 

Liberty loving patriots accept a limited government as established by our Founders. However, because of the nature of man and evil, we are ALWAYS in conflict with government, pushing back government overreach. Vigilance is the price of liberty.
"[U]ntil they spend MONTHS, even YEARS of intel gathering" -- @SCORPION 

I wish we had more "years" to prepare. That time has passed. We don't have years. 

"Inaction"?  Like you, I am standing down for now. I watch and pray the wisdom and foresight of our Founders rights the ship without a shot fired.  My patience, however, is not unlimited. Evil prospers when good men do nothing.
@SCORPION  Thanks for the exchange. I respect your thoughtful opinion. Thank you for your service. Thank you for posting.  I'm glad you're here, brother!

Has the contact reached out to you yet?
Good to hear from you jpj!
Hi Jason, I might have talked to you before. Im listening to Stuarts new vid with freeworldnews. I'm just trying to put together the dots. Stuart mentioned Pete Santilly. Is he Darren Beatties source for the article on Stuart on revolver news. I have been researching Beattie to determine why he would write that article and their is not a lot out there. I am not a vet but am a patriot. I dont want to throw anyone under the bus but I WILL search for the truth. If I can meet you there in 3 min
Ignore the 3 minute comment. Multitasking
I will tell you one thing. We were in Olympia Wa on Jan 6th and a young gal came up to me and showed me pics on her phone of antifa in black bloc changing into cammo. You might not know this but the governors mansion grounds were stormed by a group and I would bet they were leading the charge. We left probably as it was happening and did not see what happened in person.
Sorry running commentary. I listen to Steve Bannon religiously so wonder why he is so high on Beattie if Beattie is a bad guy.

Hey wild man,
Your words don't fall on deaf ears. You're trying to get some movement. Protest or discussion with demands and expectations. That's great to get something anything going. My thoughts are that with the few of us on here that take the time to comment we aren't seeing anything happening. Realistically all we are accomplishing here is jerking our dicks for the good feeling that we get because we're doing something. But that good feeling is stalling us and the leftist shit bags are making progress and having time to create their battle plans. It's past time that we have leadership, and we need face to face meetings where real discussion can happen and a plan to thowart the leftist globalists desire to  fuck the country can be shut down.
  

I get that we can't do much here with the fbi cocksucker squad watching. But if Stewart is going to run this crew he needs to send runners to state level commanders. To set the face to face meetings up. We need real action. And without the real action we are never going to be able to recruit new members, or counter the bullshit.
Good morning all!
Good Morning! 
Good morning
That makes more sense than anything else I have heard on this. My guess is there is plenty of ego to go around. Mix that with the seriousness of the times and the fear being spread and you have a perfect storm of confusion. I, like most I know in this group, just want to figure out what part to play.
Good evening all patriots, God always wins as the tide has turned shows.  The bible states you can's harvest a good crop from a bad seed. All in time my fellow patriots all in time. Don't let up, don't give in and have no limitations when it's comes to defeating Satan's children. Think of all the brave but dead soldiers when you see a democrat. I think of all my family members and friends who served. I will proudly die a 1000 deaths to protect the USA from Satan's children!! GOD is great!! President Trump is great and sent by the almighty. Press on my brothers.
Michael, this is Ken. Please consider rejoining us in the Saloon. I sent you an invite.  I don't know what passed between you and leadership in the past, and I don't care.

After you abruptly left the Saloon that evening, Kait rushed to your defense. You and me and the guys are Kait's boys. Come back. Free round of donuts when you return.  ;)

Question for folks, How much interest is there in antenna array that would have the ability to cover from 10 meter to 5Ghz via multiple antennas? I have designed an arrray that covers the FT-8900R And have access to the parts for horn antennas that would cover up to 5 GHz (possibly higher) This would allow not only regional comm's but also would allow for the creation of a MESH network that would allow for video at the legal limit for amateur radio. This would not only aid Oathkeepers but also be a very valuable resource for CEPT and other community/county level resources.

Yes this is a kit and yes there is a price tag. The worker is worth his/her labor. You want to do the design, testing and set up, go for it. If folks are interested in helping a Veteran get his family back to the US for health reasons of not only his but his children and also get comm's antenna that can greatly aid in the mid to medium range please contact me. Those who want to tell me to give this for free, can pay for a full seat of CAD software to design and test with. Most HAM's know the amount of time that goes into doing a design and getting it to work properly. Also have a mount for Duplexer  type AV-32D that not only helps keep it mounted on a 1-3/4" pole but will have option shortly up to 3" pole. Folks want to be angry at me for this. Fine I am trying to save myself and my family by moving back to the US from the UK (Scotland to be exact). If you think that the UK is a democratic country you are smoking some really good stuff. I have already won one legal case to keep my kids and don't want to deal with another round(even though the court dismissed the case with prejudice, the social services are trying to get that changed, invilotaion of Scots law, I am not th only one).

God bless folks and will be giving links if there is interest but not expecting as everyone is dealing with a lot of BS at this time.

Sorry man got busy. Mostly people either are a lone wolf prepper and think they can do it all alone or they don't understand our mission.  Either way you can lead people to water but you can't make them drink.  The rhetoric doesn't help either.  The left media paints anything patriotic as racist or domestic terrorist.  It's frustrating but you know who you are and what you stand for and that's enough.
Patriots be strong, don't let the libterd's perversion of the sacred words that hearken back to the founding of this great nation sway you one bit!

More truth bombs are coming out daily and more suppression of these truths is being forced upon all aspects of public comms. The blackout of truth is heading towards a full strength battle in the MSM to take down anyone who contradicts the MSM narrative. No debate will be allowed by the puppet masters. Expect things to deteriorate rapidly over the next few months. Strengthen local coms and prepare for disruptions. The sleepers are awakening.

Even in the 1940s and 1950s it was good to be a patriot. What would these people do about Hopalong Cassidy (Wm. Boyd), Gene Autry, or Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.

3.	Always obey your parents.
4.	Protect the weak and help them.
5.	Be brave but never take chances.
6.	Study hard and learn all you can.
7.	Be kind to animals and take care of them.
8.	Eat all your food and never waste any.
9.	Love God and go to Sunday school regularly.
  10. Always respect our flag and our country.
Good American Morning! 
Keep the faith. 
I'm neither of those things. Being willing to and capable of acting independently is merely adult thinking. Without responsibility, integrity doesn't exist. That's with anything, and anywhere. I see more concern and consideration given to those who are undeniably wrong, than to mustering the resolve of those of us opposed in any meaningful fashion. Being right isn't enough. Never has been, and it isn't now. It already feels like we're on a train to Auschwitz, looking out the windows while wondering where the Germans might be taking us. Being right didn't do a damn thing for those people then, and it won't now. At any rate, thanks for your response. It is definitely appreciated. Being made aware of some long game this patience is leading up to or serving must be above my pay grade. Be well.

The most noteworthy statements made on this site are about being at war with our government. We are at war with the government actors operating on our behalf without our guidance, support, or permission. Not only does the Constitution not support these actions, it strongly advises a vigilant citizen to not only disavow such treasonous acts, but encourages actively removing such parasites in no uncertain terms. Our oath, against enemies foreign and domestic.....purchased politicians servicing international concerns....either means something ,or it doesn't. You can't bring these people subverting the law in check with the law. They ARE the law. Now you can't vote them out, can't speak against them, can't do anything more than incessantly reiterate every single daily infraction, as if knowing you are being disrespected and disregarded somehow translates into some meaningful awareness leading to empowerment. It doesn't. It obviously hasn't. The only thing we have in our favor as citizens is our numbers. They have every other aspect of this war for America's soul not only in their favor, but under their control. We're going to hide and patiently wait.... for fucking who....? We are the Calvary, last time I checked.....
@wildman1959  Well, that is a good question. One that many of us are asking ourselves. Are we "guardians of the Republic" or not? Are we allowing a Marxist election coup to go unanswered on our soil "on our watch"? It would appear so. 

But this aint over yet. Not by a long shot. This aint over until I say it's over.
I like that. My feelings exact. Sometimes patience is NOT the way to go. In fact, it can be downright insane......just saying. Thanks for sharing!

I don't shop Costco or Sams Club.  I can't confirm stock of essentials are running low at these retailers. Has anyone witnessed essentials running low at these stores?  

Shelves are stocked full at Safeway.
_"Sometimes patience is NOT the way to go"_  @wildman1959 

It's hard to argue that point, Wildman.  When to wait and when to act; a fine line often separate these two decisions.  Patience is not always prudent, and action is not always rash.
_"We [Oath Keepers] are the Calvary, last time I checked"_  @wildman1959 

You're asking all the right questions, Wildman.  You are challenging important assumptions.  Are we the cavalry?

I'm just an OKer member like you, Wildman. I don't speak for Oath Keepers. I have my opinions, and my opinions are my own.

As I recall, going back to OKer's early days (the Obama years), the primary focus of the organization was education and fellowship. OKers was trying to spread the word to active duty service men and women the meaning of their Oath, the meaning of the US Constitution, and the meaning of illegal unconstitutional orders given them by superiors.  Being clear about what constitutes an illegal order and what doesn't is a BIG DEAL to younger active duty. In that respect, OKers was educating our active duty. It's scary and intimidating to disobey a direct order. As OKers grew in numbers---OKer patches were showing up everywhere---a sense of solidarity gave comfort to active duty knowing they would not be alone in refusing an order contrary to their Oath. They could KEEP their Oath AND their job.
@wildman1959   You're not alone, Wildman. I share some of your confusion regarding OKer's mission. Much has come to pass since the early Obama years.  I love our mission and motto "Not on our watch."  Our logo identifies us as "Guardians of the Republic." 

There is intention implied in an organization's motto, logo, etc. They identify an organization's values, purpose, and resolve.

I have to admit, I have at times inferred more meaning to "Not on our watch" and "Guardians of the Republic" than perhaps our organization originally intended. 

I suspect OKer leadership is aware of the discrepancy between messaging and assumptions made among members about who we are and what we do. Given the dire circumstances of the hour, clarification would be welcomed.
Thanks for sharing this Ron. Point made point taken!
Thanks Ron! Point taken and he made them crystal clear

Good time to reassess local preparedness and beef up support for constitutional LE...
I considered joining a number of what could be considered citizen militia organizations during the drain the swamp years. The activities of our  government actors are not Constitutional, making them criminal. In violation of the law. No one is above the law in a country governed by laws, set up that way to fairly serve all people. Now, with zero election integrity,  you would be a fool to think we the people are a real consideration. Voting the keepers of the law in as guardians officially went out the window. So all bets are off with conventional methods of addressing now very grave concerns. And unless we go outside the box, in similar, equal and diametrically opposed efforts, this republic will be lost. People mistake kindness for weakness. Those who are supposed to act as those safeguards have now become the enemy they were installed to protect us from. I joined Oath Keepers without knowing anything other than the oath, which is what I have always believed in. Like AARP, I guess I'm a dues paying member. I'm still looking for the other 17,965,000 military veterans. And any other sane people who feel compelled to not only publicly question the direction our government is leading our nation in, but are willing to stop them from going any further. And for the life of me, I can't understand why it seems to be too much to ask....? Who else is there...?
@wildman1959   It's not too much to ask. Many of us (OKers and non-OKers) are standing down waiting to see if the election audit takes hold across the states. In this respect, we wait to see if our Founding Fathers' foresight rights the ship by ballast of design.
When the full truth about the AZ audit is made public I believe this will be a turning point. A strong united stand (We the People) for equal justice under the law will see to it that the bad actors do the perp walk. Otherwise, expect a FF to shield the "Man Behind the Curtin". Any FF should be addressed in equal proportion to shine the light of truth and hold accountable all parties of the propaganda false narrative. The sleeping giant must be awakened...
Stand Ready!
nobody will probably learn about what happened in AZ; if they DO announce something nefarious went on to help the democrat case, they will censor this left and right and we'll never know about it. Someones hand needs to be forced.
from the looks of it, we're already at 7
I agree a false flag will happen to shield the results IF they are allowed to get to that point. Good list kmutley‚Ä¶..
I know this could be a false flag! But with God anything is possible. August 10th,11th & 12th. Mike lindell is putting it all out there on the election fraud and if so all hell will break out!!! Frankspeech.com watch his short video from July 17th. You all stay safe and prepared.
I would never dream of tarnishing O.K. and any members or Stewart and all that has been accomplished. If I'm recruiting, and in word and deed you can bet I am, however small or inept my efforts may be, I'm seeking the responsible. Millions of Americans feel as we do, and I damn well expect to call them, one way or another, front and center to accept their responsibility. Their is no sideline or viewing audience in this situation.

By the way, and I should have sent this to Stewart himself, here's the thing: Right now He, O.K. and us are being targeted and ostracized by the government and media. Rather than going further underground, seems openly supporting Stewart and ourselves as the angry citizens well within our rights to stand opposed to this government gone rogue would be the prudent play. He tried to advise Trump openly, but I personally agreed with every word. As do many others. Maybe this is the pivotal moment to turn the tide, bringing those silent to their feet. Radical...incendiary....? Mere adjectives. Stewart was right!

Hey there I like your logic.  I am new to all this.  Been signed up for a year but I never got a welcome package,  Probably only posted a few words here or there.  I have looked through your posts and I think your hashtag is correct... I got you figured as a serious-minded, forward leaning, straight-shooter type like a Wyatt Earp - that's good.  I also caught several others trying to rein you in a little bit - that's also good.  Frankly there is too much ambiguity in the current situation.  I see your post: "I'm seeking the responsible that feel as we do,"  I can only answer for myself. I think you called it right - literally everyone has a stake in this.

Hey Nationalvp, this is America. Land of the free, home of the brave. The limitations that restrain, we create.....where are you by the way. I'll be heading out west at the end of the month for a patriot reunion. Other than that, Michigan is home, and where I'll be.
Thanks mc547. I'm no Wyatt Earp, trust me. Just a man who feels like he and others of my generation might have dropped the ball with our responsibility as citizens. The real nosedive took place right after Kennedy said it and was assassinated. Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country....? After joining the Marines and seeing what has been going on in the world in the name of politics and government, I realized even then if I ever pick up an M-16 again, I'm going to DC with it. And it may happen, since the biggest enemy we have is right here in our own government.....House cleaning is mandatory. Senate too. And Judiciary. Think that'll happen with fixed and phony elections....? So I appreciate the prudent, but those who know better are getting too old to do anything about it either way. Hindsight in Germany doesn't honor the prudent, does it...?
Hey there Wildman.  I think you and I are contemporaries.  Like you I am not comfortable with 2022 elections having watched the swindle...  I don't like the thought of it but I think we are in the lull before the storm.  There is nothing wrong with our form of government, rather there are bad-actors with divided loyalties within it.  To make matters worst those critters have linkages to outsiders with agendas and influence like Sorros and his tribe; and high tech moguls like Gates and Zuckerberg who can leverage through denial of service tactics their political position and can call up a rent-a-crowd of political operatives to cause a news-worthy ground swell.  They look formidable, but I don't think they have the depth.  That is why they need to steer from with in the government, like a coup.  Hence the reason they attacked Trump and forced him out.  Striking is the breadth of ineptness within government presently, ie the Supreme Court completely caved under the lack of leadership by  Roberts.  It is obvious our country is being contested for right now.  We are waffling as a country trying to right itself.  What needs to happen now is patriots still within the government need use the tactics of the left, and stall and obstruct the flow of criminal activity within.  Hopefully the evil within would stall out like a Sumo match.  - we need some leathernecks, stiff-necks and red-necks within to slow things down.  If you are a praying man it is good time to do that.  You were correct again about Germany as a case study provides a lot of utility.

I'll be in Fremont County for a week. Lived in Wyoming from March 2008 to October 2016. Loved it.
Well, mc547 thanks for sharing your views. Your assessment matches my own: the left has the career purchased politicians, the media mouthpieces, and more visible factions flooding all conversations. But they have zero depth. All presentation designed to waylay and forestall any tangible efforts to 
 stop their nonsense. So, no, patience at this late date is not on my dance card. It'll take millions, so I'm looking for millions. There are millions, after all. So that is my sole objective. Simple. I'm not waiting for a damn thing. I live here. Give me liberty or give me death. That came before the Star Spangled Banner and the Pledge of Allegiance. First things first....I'm not crazy. I AM livid. That's me.
I'll be visiting some patriot brothers there. I'm hoping to visit with Gerry Spence in Dubois as well while I' there. The legal aspects of Homeland Security attacks on citizens could be a pertinent and viable niche to use as a foothold in creating a rallying point for bringing people out openly against this rogue
government. The OK saying is Honor Your Oath - Join us! With 35,000 members and 18 million veterans who swore that oath, be nice to see them step up to the plate, no...?
17,965,000 MIA or AWOL . Straight up, right...?

Hey there.
Hey there.  I wrote a few questions below:  My hashtag is mc547... I assume with your handle and terse message you are the belly button for clarity - Yes?  Besides the questions I posted below, an Administrative Question I have is: How do I pay for another year of bulletin board access - my annual dues date is but days away?
I assume this bulletin board is national in scope?  What is Rocket Chat I see advertised?  I assume it is some type of alert system that rides on a smartphone or device?  So OK as an organization can Flash Mob some event???  Did anyone out there get a welcome package, or intro-letter?
Mc547 this is Rocket Chat and this is our system to speak with each other on a variety of topics. There are threads for each state as well so do a search for it and join your state. Some are more active then others. It will be #NC or SC something like that. As far as welcome packets National is getting reorganized, 6 Jan has caused some havoc
Hey there hit me up on ProtonMail at DaveyE7@protonmail.com. If you do not have a ProtonMail account I would get one. Once you hit me up I will give you directions to getting on an alternate way we have been communicating. Welcome to OK
Good morning my Patriot brethren! 
DaveyE7 thank you for assistance.  I will follow up as you recommended.
Hey There.  I am getting plugged in.
Hey Brothers, I'm going to let my membership lapse in November and leave Oath Keepers. Should anyone wish to contact me, leave a DM and we can exchange contact information. Our government is using the media to turn Stewart Rhodes and Joe Biggs and other patriots into terrorists. This could not be further from the truth. I'm not anti-government. I am through with our government. Career politicians acting like television game show hosts deserve no respect. Purchased politicians at that. This charade must end. There are 18 million veterans who swore that oath to defend this nation against enemies foreign and domestic. The enemies we face are domestic, with our own government. Criminals do not police, much less convict themselves. With obviously questionable elections being held, with the support of the Judiciary, these government actors are virtually selecting themselves as well. So much for We The People. Patriots stake their lives and their fortunes for the freedom we hold dear. Fuck the FBI and the alphabet agencies and the military too. If their jobs being jeopardized for political reasons is more of a concern than standing up for the citizens you are sworn to protect, what fucking good are you to those citizens....? Liberty and Justice have become two whores, twin sisters, both prostituting themselves for a worthless dollar that will never be enough for either one of them. Without responsibility, integrity does not exist. It would be imaginary, at best.Though I might not be capable of leading those who feel responsible, I might be able to find them. We can worry about calling a muster then, shouldn't be a problem, right. Meantime, using words that failing to inspire merely piss off fellow patriots defeats the purpose of saying them. I'll pass, and would never wish to do so. I'll check my DM every Sunday from now until my membership lapses, and will reply in a timely fashion. Or you might run into me, if I'm successful with my quest. Thanks. Christopher E. Wilding
I'm letting my membership lapse. I need to locate those missing veterans and other responsible patriots ASAP. I'll be in Wyoming at the end of the month should you be interested in what I have to say. I'd love to hear the same from you. Regardless, I wish Stewart and his Oath Keepers well. Thanks!
Hey, Chris. Would you like to exchange contact info?
Ya brother,  I'm out here in Nebraska.  Rsmutny@protonmail.com
Hey Chris I know your heart is in the right place and your frustrations are felt and shared by many! I wish you strength and nothing but the best in your endeavors. 
Duty Honor Country, 
Gary

Sure would. Christopher E. Wilding, (734) 478-9756  I usually text to see if you can accept a call. Otherwise, wildchris2000@yahoo.com. I'm in Dearborn Heights, Michigan.
Anytime he wants to meet he can call and I'll meet him just ask him to give me a day or two notice in case I have a unit to install or a service call I'm committed too. I haven't heard anything since you asked me "July 16th" if he contacted me.  I'll work something out when it's good for him.
So difficult not to be discouraged.  Worked for over a decade in fire/EMS, now retired.  Been a nurse for 14 years.  Watching my colleagues stick their heads in the sand and put their patients' lives at risk to collude with the politicians for power and profit is so disheartening.  We are worse than the doctors and nurses in Nazi Germany because no one is putting a gun to our heads or threatening to torture our children (yet).  Everyone being coerced to take shots they don't need or want. Silencing those who speak of good, effective treatments. How much longer can the honest and decent among us hold out? Will they get rid of us all?
Hey there Utah,
I'm just checking in with you all. 
I'm thinking of moving and looking at cooler mountain regions with good tax breaks for disabled vets, pro 2A and mostly conservative politically. 
If any of my Utah brothers or sisters would care to share their views on living there I would greatly appreciate it!

Hey dranem, thanks for standing up and standing out. We are not supposed to fear our government, they are supposed to fear us. Our repercussions, our reprisals. Not the other way around, which is where we are. These fucks need to know of our displeasure, first hand, in each and every one of our angry faces. Publicly! We live here! We have the right and the freedom, and included in that Constitution, the responsibility and duty as well. Is everyone going to suck a corporate or government dick for dollars that aren't worth the paper they are printed on, hoping the nation doesn't tank before they get to spend them. WTF! We can fix anything, easily, but you can't fix stupid. I'm not willing to squander this precious and God given birthright with my thumbs up my ass....we WILL stop this madness, before it stops us!

Today, Wednesday, August 11 , 2021, the United States government will conduct its first nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) formerly known as the Emergency Broadcast System, but there is a VERY STRANGE WARNING as part of this test; The test will last 5-10 minutes and your TV and phones MAY HAVE TO BE REBOOTED after the test!

According to a notice from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the nationwide test will reach all TV's, radios, and cellular telephones.  The test will begin sometime between 2:00 PM and 2:20 PM eastern time, which, of course, translates into 1:00 Central time, 12 Noon Mountain time, 11:00 Pacific time, 10:00 Alaska time and 9:00 Hawaii time.

Was no EBS test here on west coast yesterday? What about the East, any test?
I made sure to turn off emergency alerts on my cell so I wouldn't get any bad juju just in case the rumors were true.
Wasn't around the TV much either to see.
You all want to watch this before they take it down. SR discusses the current situation and lays out how we should be handling it.

From Steve Quayle web site:
WHAT REALLY WENT ON DURING THE FCC-DHS-EBS TEST,WEDNESDAY AUG11TH WITH PHONES AND SMART TV'S
TO EXPLAIN SOME DETAIL WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED YESTERDAY AND LIKELY WHY MANY PEOPLE DID NOT SEE OR GET MAYBE WHAT THEY EXPECTED.

1> ABOUT THE 2 TESTS WHICH WERE RUN AT THE SAME TIME:

THE FIRST PART OF THE TEST WAS TO SEND AUDIO AND VIDEO TO ALL TELEVISIONS AND CABLE BOXES ETC WHICH WERE TURNED ON AT THE TIME OF THE TEST. THE STEPS OF THIS PART OF THE TEST OPERATE LIKE THIS:

A> GRAB CONTROL OF THE CABLE BOX AND SMART TV (IF THERE WAS A LISTENING SMART TV TURNED ON). AFTER GRABBING CONTROL THEN THE TEST MESSAGE BOTH AUDIO AND VIDEO WERE SENT TO THE TV SETS TO DISPLAY THE ALERT TEST MESSAGE.

B> THERE WAS ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CABLE COMPANIES AND TV BROADCASTERS THAT AFTER THE TEST REBOOT YOUR CABLE BOX AND SMART TV SET (OR TURN THEM OFF AND BACK ON TO RESET THEM). THIS IMPLIES THAT THE TESTS GRABBED HARD CONTROL OF THE CABLE BOXES AND SMART TV SETS.

2> AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BROADCAST TO ALL TV SETS WAS BEING MADE THE FOLLOWING WAS HAPPENING WITH CELL PHONES

2A> IF AND ONLY IF YOU HAD SIGNED UP WITH FCC AND DHS AS A VOLUNTEER TO HELP PARTICIPATE IN THE TEST WOULD YOU GET A TEXT MESSAGE ANNOUNCING THE TEST.

2B> AT THE SAME TIME AND INDEPENDENT OF THE TEST MESSAGES GOING OUT TO THE VOLUNTEERS, A SOFTWARE DOWN LOAD WAS SENT TO ALL CELL PHONES WHICH WERE TURNED ON DURING THE TEST TIME.
(THERE WAS NO ANNOUNCEMENT MADE CONCERNING THE SOFTWARE DOWNLOAD OTHER THAN TO REBOOT YOUR CELL PHONE AFTER THE TESTING TIME EVEN IF YOU DID NOT SIGN UP AS A VOLUNTEER TO TAKE PART IN THE TEST.)

THE COMPLETE FUNCTION OF THE SOFTWARE DOWNLOADED IS NOT YET FULLY KNOWN, BUT WE KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO TRACK AND LISTEN AND WATCH SILENTLY, SO IT MAKES LOGICAL SENSE THAT A PIECE OF SPY SOFTWARE WAS DOWNLOADED TO ALL AVAILABLE CELL PHONES.

I HOPE THIS MAKES THE SERIES OF EVENTS OF YESTERDAY MORE CLEAR.
'I REALIZE AS TIME MOVES ON THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE A HARDER AND HARDER TIME BELIEVING BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT SEEN SUCH EVIL IN THEIR LIVES' AND THUS BRUSH ASIDE AT THEIR OWN PERIL! PEOPLE ARE SO USED TO THINKING THAT THEY ARE IN CONTROL OF THEIR PHONE WHEN IN FACT THAT IS NOT THE TRUTH AT ALL.

YES THE PEOPLE INCLUDING YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE APPS OF CHOICE SO THAT YOUR PHONE BEHAVES HOW YOU WANT IT TO BEHAVE FOR YOU,

BUT NO ONE STOPS TO THINK THAT THE TELEPHONE COMPANY OR APPLE OR SAMSUNG ETC (OR A GOVERNMENT BODY) CAN ALSO DOWNLOAD (AND WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE) NEW SOFTWARE FOR YOUR PHONE -SG:

Anyone here from Iowa?
If you get a chance ask him to call me again. Or anyone  in my area.

HEADS UP!   ATTENTION ALL! 

Ben W16A WY had a great idea:  

All of us who are QUALIFIED (training/xperience/fitness) and WILLING to volunteer to go to Afghanistan to help rescue American Citizens trapped there need to step up and let it be known that we are willing to go. 

We don't have a pot to piss in, financially, but we do have seriously legit veterans with the right skillsets.  

And I know Glen Beck just raised 20 Million, and there are likely others also working on a private effort to do what the Biden regime refuses to do.  

So, we will ask our members who have necessary training and experience to volunteer and then put out a public statement that we have trained and experienced men willing to go, and all we need is transport and coordination with whoever else is taking the bull by the horns.  

It's a matter of honor.  And I agree with Ben that it needs to be done.  

What do you think?
(From: SR) II.

Please cross post that on other threads. 

I'm putting Ben in charge of vetting and selecting all volunteers.  He has extensive combat experience in Afghanistan, so he knows what he will need.
(From: SR) III.

Any other highly experiences combat vets who want to assist Ben in organizing an Oath Keepers volunteer unit for such a mission, please sound off.  

Please cross post all of that on all other chats.  

What will the mission be?   Whatever is needed by whoever has the planes/helicopters/money.   Have gun will travel. 

I'll let Ben take it from here.  But as for me, I'd be game to do a combat jump in if that's what it takes.  No fucking way can we let American women fall into Taliban hands.

Please keep this in house and on the down low for now!

Good morning all Oath Keepers
First of all, we need to stop complying. Say no to masks, say no to shots, stop following CDC "guidelines" and whatever mandates the political class is trying to enforce. We need to demand the resignation of every elected and appointed official who has been part of the Covid scam as well as the debacle in Afghanistan. Right now it is a game of chicken and it seems as though the bad guys are winning, but I want to believe there are still enough decent Americans in this country that we haven't lost her yet. Can we do it at the polls in 2022? I don't know. That might be rigged, too. Will it be too late by then? I hope not.
Do not comply!

I‚Äôm hearing we are up to 12 dead Americans at Kabul airport‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Where the hell is Beijing Biden.  
Agreed stillflying and Ron. I hope enough light has been shed in the shenanigans that 2022 election will be good. Not holding my breath though either and preparing for worse to come 
In his basement counting his money and ordering crack for Hunter
Not only a bounty of weapons but Biden left behind stacks and stacks of $100 dollar bills for the Taliban!
Hey Tim,
Has anyone approached you about coming on board the Oath Keepers Signal chat? It started out as a backup to the RC in the event it gets deplatformed. If you're interested let me know, you'll find quite a bit more activity there.
Though we don't want to forsake the RC all together.
You will have to sign into the Signal app. It is the best we have so far for encrypted chat. We also highly recommend that everyone starts a protonmail account. Another well encrypted method of communication. 
Thank you brother, 
Gary
That was a sarcastic thumbs up. This asshat is messing shit up so fast‚Ä¶.

Good morning. Thank God for another day on this earth. May He keep us safe and our mouths tightly clamped shut today (especially at work).

Last time I think I loaded via credit card.  When I originally signed up.  Do you keep that information?  Or can I mail a check?  I note there was an office in Texas that was listed on the general OK website, can I mail a check with my OK ID?  Note you mention to send you my membership dues and you will get me updated - Please advise.
Good morning all. Thankful to wake up in the United States of America.  May she live to see another day! (and thank you to anyone working today - I am grateful for the day off!)

It may be slow here, However, things keep moving along behind the scenes. Hold the line, do not give up more ground. Stand ready. As the truth comes out there will be many who get very upset about the lies being exposed. Over the next few months ahead expect chaos and confusion.  Prepare to help guide the confused that are now awakening. After learning the truth many will need to see solutions to the problems.
For nothing is hidden that will not become evident, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light.

Quiet here... Calm before the storm? Unpleasant news will become unavoidable to all those who have had the blinders on. Expect all efforts (FF) to take attention away from the dirty details coming out over the next few months. Information black out by whatever means to suppress the truth.
Eyes open. Stand Guard.

So it seems that the imposter in chief has thrown down the gauntlet. "Use my power as President to Get (Governors who oppose him) out of the way."  The stage is now set for actual Civil War in the USA.
Eyes open. Antenna's up. BS radar on.
The mask is finally off; Joe Biden is not only an illegitimate President who took office by stealing the November, 2020 federal election, but he now appears to be a full-on Tyrant commiting treason.
Not on my watch. Protecting the innocents is now a priority.
if you have anyone in my area have them contact me please. Work has slowed I can meet at other locations.
Be prepared, and prepare yourself, you and all your companies that are assembled about you, and be a guard for them.
For nothing is hidden that will not become evident, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light.  So take care how you listen; for whoever has, to him more shall be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him.‚Äù

Yes this forum is closely watched by the evil ones. Yes some of us need to wait in the shadows. And yes some of us will put themselves out in front. Yes this is a personal decision. At some point things will escalate to the point that self defense, to protect ones own life and those of our neighbors, loved ones and communities will be unavoidable.
Remember our dedicated heroes who ran into the fire to save lives. The ultimate sacrifice. We will never forget, and stand ready to fill position six and move forward

Sorry it took me so long to see this. I‚Äôve been on signal for a couple of years . Just need an invite.
If the offer is still open my user id is EX-ASA
DM me if you're active in Kansas, let's get face to face soon. Need to have a productive fall.
Good morning and afternoon Oath Keepers.
I would strongly suggest taking this question to your local HAM Radio club and present these ideas. Then again, if you know anyone with a background in Military Comms, there is a another avenue to present these questions.  Of course you would have to report back to the group on your findings...
Good morning all!! Have a great Friday!!
What is with all this shadow crap?  WHERE are the people with backbone on here?
so i came upon a great idea the other day
we need to stage a new Boston Tea Party
but put a COVID19/Liberal spin on it
biodegradable masks
Not sure everyone disappeared a while back. Sure is disheartening. 
Can anyone direct me to a place I can buy Oath Keeper hoodies/hats etc?
You can design your own at Vistaprint. Download whatever Oath keepers image from the web and use that for your design. Here is the link: https://www.vistaprint.com/all-products?xnid=TopNav_All+Products&xnav=TopNav

Just returned from a road trip this past week.
Off grid
Standing by. As always.
In the shadows, I guess...
However we all should be available for events locally. Freedom rallies around the globe today.
But, the word is to steer clear of DC today...
These are doomsday preppers.... of course, they call it doomsday because its too fucking late, so what kind of preparation would prove itself useful at that point is beyond me....as a USMC veteran, I found preventive maintenance a useful practice. I was hoping some consideration would be given to keeping this government gone rogue from destroying this country and the world along with it, rather than thinking we might somehow survive through and outlast utter mayhem and chaos, but that's just me, I guess...
Fuck the evil ones. Hunting these sick bastards down is becoming the only sane option. Before the entire world trips all over itself trying to deal with something worse than the sniffles.....it doesn't matter how we do it, it only matters that we do it. We WHO...? We the People, that's who! Thou shall fear no evil....
Hey buddy I'm not quite tracking with you on this comment. would expand on this so I can go all in.
Hey Brother, after meeting with some high minded and heavy weight trial lawyers on my trip to Wyoming, I've come to a conclusion. Since money is the root of all evil, and most people are tethered to a situation where they are afraid to do anything that might topple their own personal apple cart, random acts of disobedience if not blatant outrage may be the only way to strike a nerve in the backbone of patriots. Some might follow, none dare lead. There just isn't a kinder more gentle solution to stopping this government in its tracks. Like patriots I've talked to everywhere, and I vehemently disagree with all of them, prepping to outlast an inevitable collapse with unpredictable consequences and ramifications seems the best anyone will do. Folks can disagree on the world super powers unleashing biological weapons on the civilian populations. What they can't argue is the fact that we are all currently fighting a biological war, no matter who started it, without giving Congress the consent to declare any acts of war, while allowing government to aim more weapons at the citizens civil liberties than the perceived threat being posed. Gerry Spence might have started as a simple country lawyer. These fuckers today are the biggest individual winners of nearly every settlement they involve themselves in. Highly publicized pro bono work leverages mass tort multi-million dollar participation, more sales pitch than altruism. When the bough breaks, the cradle of civilization may fall, so like all lawyers, they prefer to bend the law into more profitable interpretations. Apparently, after Kennedy, the white hats have determined that you can't beat them, so that leaves joining them. Acting like you disagree with something you consistently go along with is quite the juggling act, but common. I haven't come up with a plan even I can go all in on, my friend, but I believe I will simply because I have no faith in patience whatsoever. Patience, today, feels like looking for ways out of things, rather than into them. For me, anyway. I very rarely, in my life, got anywhere with anything I've done, inadvertently. See no sense of getting used to the view of things I shouldn't be looking at to begin with. I'll pick a Constitutional fight the government can't avoid one way or another. At least, that's the plan. Still. And I'll get word of it to Montana one way or another, and we'll still do lunch, my friend!

Let's get something straight. Government overreach is nothing new, nor are concerns regarding this matter. In 1819 the first and arguably most important Supreme Court decision rendered having to do with federal powers, McCulloch vs. Maryland, the court ruled Congress, with its Necessary and Proper clause in Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, was free to use its implied powers to create and regulate with law. The ink had barely dried on the document from it being written roughly 30 years prior. So Big Brother isn't new, nor the Holding Company. The citizens of this country may not be subjects to the government as such, but are damn sure subjected to blatant and constant meddling of every kind by the government. With little to no objection, I might add. Like a 20 year war in Afghanistan approved and funded via such implication from Article 1, with clause 12 in Section 8 specifically stating no such military action could be approved of nor funded for more than a period of two years. Yet with the government creation of the Department of Homeland Security, one of countless in house ideas, those in office are using Constitutionally granted powers to circumvent Constitutional  limitations to those powers. With the same Article, no less. Since there is obviously no end to what lengths some people will go to create meaning beneficial to themselves within our government, it should be no surprise that purpose and intent are both equal opportunity employers, and more colorful use of Constitutional privileges by We the People are not only the order of the day, but long overdue!
